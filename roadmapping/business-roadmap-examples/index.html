<p>In our last chapter we specified that business roadmaps are effective vehicles for visualizing and communicating business growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we broke down the most common roadmap use case for visualizing business growth, it’s definitely not <em>the</em> only way to spin your business roadmap; a business roadmap can take on countless forms.</p>
<p>To help narrow the scope for any business planning their own growth, we’ve outlined eight business roadmap examples below that are aimed at organizations looking to scale. (<a href="../../roadmap-templates-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html"><strong>Btw, all of these roadmaps are available in our template library which you can check out here!</strong></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic roadmap</li>
<li>Change roadmap</li>
<li>Capability roadmap</li>
<li>Business development roadmap</li>
<li>Business intelligence roadmap</li>
<li>Data strategy roadmap</li>
<li>Startup roadmap</li>
<li>Enterprise architecture roadmap</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="searchingfortherighttoolforyourroadmappingneedsletourroadmaptoolguidehelpyou">Searching for the right tool for your roadmapping needs? Let our <a href="../../product-roadmap-tools-comparison-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html"><strong>roadmap tool guide</strong></a> help you.</h6>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-1.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-1"></p>
<h2 id="strategicroadmap">Strategic roadmap</h2>
<p>Simply put, a strategic roadmap communicates your business’ vision. Outlining the steps to achieve your mission, this business roadmap example hinges on long-term objectives and deadlines. Keyword: long-term. That means ixnay on including product features and short-term wins; this roadmap is reserved for overarching goals like fundraising rounds and MRR targets.</p>
<p>Generally owned by senior-level stakeholders, this roadmap should be accessible to every employee (not to edit per se, but to view). By granting this access, you align your entire organization on your plans to grow the business and you encourage teams to develop projects that contribute directly to said growth.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-1.svg" alt="bus-2-1"></p>
<p>For organizations planning their business growth strategy over the next few months, quarters or years, use a <strong>Timeline View</strong>. Businesses can use this view to track key initiatives and milestones that each of your departments will undertake to contribute to the overall mission.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-2.svg" alt="bus-2-2"></p>
<p>A <strong>Swimlane View</strong> is for businesses that are less strict about the “when” of their strategic planning. This roadmap assigns each team an individual swimlane, and organizes their respective strategic initiatives by status. This way, any stakeholder can quickly glance and know what strategic project is upcoming, in progress or completed.</p>
<p><mark>Plan to achieve your big vision with our <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/strategic-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">ready-to-use strategic roadmap template</a></strong>.</mark></p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-2.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-2"></p>
<h2 id="changeroadmap">Change roadmap</h2>
<p>Business growth requires many, <em>many</em> changes that a business needs to communicate across the board—especially for heavyweight, complex organizations. A change roadmap visualizes and expresses how a business plans to evolve in order to achieve scaling.</p>
<p>Similar to a strategic roadmap, your change roadmap gets employees bought-into your business’ long-term plan. In this case, we’re talking a long-term plan of change initiatives, like team restructures, current system overhauls or introductions of new infrastructures. This roadmap is particularly useful for team leads responsible for implementing change processes within their teams.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-3.svg" alt="bus-2-3"></p>
<p>For businesses that want to explicitly see how changes will unfold in the future, a <strong>Timeline View</strong> best serves you. Breaking down change processes team-by-team, this view aligns the entire business on how each team will progress with the business. What makes this view even handier is the fact that you can surface major milestones, so every team has deadlines to work towards.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-4.svg" alt="bus-2-4"></p>
<p>Since change is unpredictable, assigning a schedule to it isn’t exactly easy. Hence, why we offer a <strong>Swimlane View</strong>. Not focused on dates, a swimlane change roadmap offers a more flexible alternative for evolving businesses. Still breaking down change by team, this roadmap view groups change initiatives based on their status such as research, planning and review.</p>
<p><mark>Get ahead of the effects of business growth with our <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/change-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">change roadmap template</a></strong>.</mark></p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-3.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-3"></p>
<h2 id="capabilityroadmap">Capability roadmap</h2>
<p>You know those big projects you’ve always envisioned, but they’re so grand they take years to implement? Yeah, a capability roadmap helps you plan how to execute these projects.</p>
<p>Plotting the large-scale capabilities a business wants to tackle in the next few quarters or years, a capability roadmap revolves around potential rather than your present projects. It plans the super-ambitious, game-changing goals beyond features and releases. Think launching 5 product lines in three years, or opening up a global office in Europe, or owning 25% of the market share in two years.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-5.svg" alt="bus-2-5"></p>
<p>Seeing as this roadmap is meant for planning years into the future, a <strong>Timeline View</strong> of your capability roadmap just makes sense. Showcasing each team’s planned capabilities for the next few years, the timeline capability roadmap paints the big picture of where your business is going and when they plan on getting there.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-6.svg" alt="bus-2-6"></p>
<p>If a timeline is too detailed for your capability plans, a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> might be more up your alley. Organizing your plans into loose and/or fuzzy time buckets like years or “Future,” this roadmap view offers a digestible snapshot of how and when each team plans on tackling capability initiatives.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-4.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-4"></p>
<h2 id="businessdevelopmentroadmap">Business development roadmap</h2>
<p>For super-speedy businesses barreling towards major growth by the end of the year, a business development roadmap is an ideal asset for your toolkit. This roadmap highlights the essential tasks that contribute to rapid revenue and market-share growth, often in a one-year timeframe.</p>
<p>Sales, marketing and product champion this roadmap as they use this tool to plan and communicate their business development projects that play a hand in aggressive business growth. For example, sales can use this roadmap to visualize their “land and expand” strategies, while product can outline initiatives like a referral program or live chat that will capture more customers—and ultimately rake in $$.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-7.svg" alt="bus-2-7"></p>
<p>The <strong>Timeline View</strong> of a business development roadmap says to the entire organization, “Hey, here’s how each team will contribute to business development over the next year.” Any team at your business can sneak a peek at this roadmap to understand how the rest of the organization will participate in “biz dev” and thus, plan their initiatives accordingly.</p>
<p>Milestones can clearly highlight the KPIs the business wants to hit during this growth period, thereby giving your teams specific goals (and deadlines) to strive towards. On top of that, you can also explicitly communicate external factors, like changes to privacy laws or updates to a certain OS, that could muddy the “biz dev” waters.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-8.svg" alt="bus-2-8"></p>
<p>For the less deadline-oriented businesses, a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> lets you bucket your business development tasks into loose buckets such as quarters. It’s a sweet and simple way to manage all the teams’ expectations on when certain things must get done.</p>
<p><mark>Reach your biz dev goals (even) faster with our <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/business-development-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">business development roadmap template</a></strong>.</mark></p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-5.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-5"></p>
<h2 id="businessintelligenceroadmap">Business intelligence roadmap</h2>
<p>For business intelligence (BI) teams wanting to maximize their effect on organizational decisions and growth, enlist in a business intelligence roadmap. Owned and operated by BI managers and their teams, this type of roadmap visualizes and communicates all aspects of BI including data mining and analysis to querying and reporting.</p>
<p>BI managers can use this roadmap to plan how their team can optimize internal business processes to be more efficient, which leads to better informed decisions by the business, which culminates in scaling. An added benefit of this roadmap is that it helps BI managers inform the rest of the organization and C-level executives about what BI is doing and how they plan on being a part of the business’ bigger picture.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-9.svg" alt="bus-2-9"></p>
<p>In our template library we offer two views for your BI roadmap. The Timeline View allows BI teams to portray how their activities and initiatives will occur over the next months, quarters or years. With a focus on KPIs and major dates, this view allows BI teams to plan their initiatives to knock down these targets.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-10.svg" alt="bus-2-10"></p>
<p>The <strong>Swimlane View</strong> of the BI roadmap hones in on the BI team’s higher-level goals versus the dates that they’re hitting. Assigning BI tasks to different business verticals like data governance, process improvement or architecture &amp; infrastructure, this roadmap then organizes tasks based on BI goals like strategy, growth and efficiency.</p>

<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-6.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-6"></p>
<h2 id="datastrategyroadmap">Data strategy roadmap</h2>
<p>A data strategy roadmap tells the rest of your organization how you’ll improve your business’ data operations—such as data collection, storage, management, and application. Well-planned and properly stored data = better business decisions = better organizational growth.</p>
<p>This roadmap tends to fall into the hands of your CIOs, CTOs and data teams. These data-leaning individuals use this roadmap to ensure their business’ data strategy fits nicely with not only their business processes, but security and information management best practices.</p>
<p>Think of this roadmap as a way to answer any pressing questions—internally and externally—regarding how your business handles data. Are you legally (and ethically) collecting the right data from your users when they visit your website? Are you storing any “unclean” data that should be expunged from your records? What security protocols are in place in case of a data breach?</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-11.svg" alt="bus-2-11"></p>
<p>With our <strong>Timeline View</strong> showcase the data initiatives planned for the future. Splitting the roadmap into three different phases—planning, process and review—the timeline roadmap streamlines your data strategy so that the rest of the organization can easily digest the data plan.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-12.svg" alt="bus-2-12"></p>
<p>For more flexibility with your data strategy, apply a <strong>Swimlane View</strong>. Rather than mapping data initiatives across an extensive timeline, the team’s activities and tasks are sorted into smaller time frames like months or quarters. This way, the team (and organization) can see which types of data security initiatives are getting priority and when.</p>
<p><mark>Get your data strategy in order with our <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/data-strategy-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">data strategy roadmap template</a></strong>.</mark></p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-7.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-7"></p>
<h2 id="startuproadmap">Startup roadmap</h2>
<p>While a business roadmap can be adapted for any-sized organization, the reality is if you don’t have many teams or resources, the common business roadmap template <em>might</em> not be as applicable. That’s why we suggest a startup roadmap for businesses still finding their footing.</p>
<p>A startup roadmap helps smaller businesses plan how they’ll get off the ground running and then scale to a much larger size. Because starting your own business is very much a roller coaster of an experience, a startup roadmap helps bring some clarity to the messy and experimental process.</p>
<p>As a fresh-out-the-gate business, startups tend not to be heavily process-oriented. As a result, startup roadmaps lean more on the high-level and flexible side (as should all roadmaps!), so as to adapt quickly with the often-chaotic startup environment. The roadmap is a small business’ way of zooming in on their end goal (hint: business growth) and mapping out a feasible plan to achieve said goal.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-13.svg" alt="bus-2-13"></p>
<p>With the <strong>Timeline View</strong>, a startup roadmap can clearly and effectively lay out all the future tasks that need to be completed to get your business standing. Pivot your data based on teams, owners, or theme depending on how early you are in the startup game. And also highlight any crucial milestones you’re aiming for, so that you can bring some razor-sharp focus to the up-and-down startup process.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-14.svg" alt="bus-2-14"></p>
<p>The truth is, as a startup, you’re probably not too strict about timelines, nor are you actually sticking to everyone. So, that’s where a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> is most useful. For startups that just aren’t as confident (or trusting) of their timelines, apply a swimlane view for your business where the focus is on what the status of each project is, not when it’s getting pushed out.</p>
<p><mark>Startups, we got you. Chart your growth with our customizable <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/startup-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">startup roadmap template</a></strong>.</mark></p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/07/Bus-ch2-8.svg" alt="Bus-ch2-8"></p>
<h2 id="enterprisearchitectureroadmap">Enterprise architecture roadmap</h2>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you’ve got enterprises that also need a roadmap to bring clarity to the chaos as well. Designed for your big corporations and complex, towering businesses, an enterprise architecture roadmap presents how an enterprise will evolve its own infrastructure in the coming years.</p>
<p>Focusing on organizational agility, efficiency and stability, this business roadmap illustrates the steps that will be taken to evolve the enterprise’s architecture from status quo to end goal. Mapping and planning this evolution communicates to the rest of the organization how the enterprise will stay competitive and brace itself for changes in the market.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-15.svg" alt="bus-2-15"></p>
<p>For those businesses wanting to explicitly see how the enterprise infrastructure will evolve over (insert here) timeframe, a <strong>Timeline View</strong> is your best bet. Not only does this roadmap chart an enterprise’s evolution across different business verticals like product, applications and strategy, but it also puts heavy emphasis on goals and KPIs that the enterprise is concerned with.</p>
<p><img src="../content/images/2018/06/bus-2-16.svg" alt="bus-2-16"></p>
<p>For enterprises that want to provide a quick summary of their business growth, a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> may be more your speed. Charting enterprise architecture projects across flexible timeframes like months or quarters, this roadmap provides an overtly-transparent depiction of which project will be completed when.</p>
<p><mark>Bigwig businesses, we've got an <strong><a href="../../roadmap-templates/enterprise-architecture-roadmap-utm_campaign=Roadmapping%20Field%20Guide&amp;utm_source=BusinessRoadmapChapter2.html">enterprise architecture template</a></strong> you can make your own.</mark></p>
