				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.1</h4></td>
				<td><p class="col2 bottom"><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> The Agreement, including these Terms and any Order Form and including all exhibits and schedules and any other documents incorporated by reference, collectively constitute the entire agreement and understanding between Roadmunk and the Customer regarding Subscription Services, and supersedes any and all prior written or verbal agreements, proposals or representations. In the event of an inconsistency between the Terms and any Order Form, the Order Form shall prevail to the extent necessary to remedy such inconsistency. Headings in the Agreement are for convenience only and will have no legal meaning or effect. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it may be severed and the remainder of the provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provisions must be in writing, and failure by either party to exercise any right or enforce strict performance of any provision does not constitute a waiver of that right. No modification or amendment of the Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties, and neither the course of conduct between Roadmunk and the Customer, nor any trade practice, shall act to modify any provision thereof.</p></td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.2</h4></td>
				<td><p class="col2 bottom"><strong>Assignment.</strong> The Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without Roadmunk’s prior written consent. Any attempt to assign without such consent will be null and void, and the Customer agrees to notify Roadmunk immediately of any change of ownership. Roadmunk may assign this Agreement and subcontract or delegate its obligations hereunder to any third party without the consent of, but on notice to, the Customer. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement and the terms and conditions will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.</p></td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.3</h4></td>
				<td><p class="col2 bottom"><strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> In the event of a dispute of the terms of the Agreement, the parties will use good faith efforts to settle such dispute within thirty days of notice of the dispute being delivered, failing which the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act (Ontario). The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.4</h4></td>
				<td><p class="col2 bottom"><strong>Notices.</strong> Any notice given by one party to the other shall be sufficiently given if (a) personally delivered or couriered, (b) mailed by regular mail, or (c) sent by facsimile or other electronic transmission, and shall be deemed to be received by the recipient on the fifth business day after mailing, if sent by mail, and on the day of delivery if delivered or sent by facsimile.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions shall not be applicable to any obligation involving the payment of money by the Customer.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.7</h4></td>
				<td><p class="col2 bottom"><strong>Governing Law.</strong> The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada, as applicable, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. The Customer irrevocably and unconditionally attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario arising in connection with the Agreement.</p></td>

			<tr>
				<td valign="top"><h4 class="col1">7.8</h4></td>
