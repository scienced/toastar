<p class="p1">Listen to the episode below:</p>

<p class="p1">As we reach our final stretch of exploring <strong>the human side of product</strong>, we&#8217;re joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-mills-1a00319" target="_blank"><strong>Ben Mills</strong></a>, Head of Product at Venmo, this episode.</p>
<p>Overseeing a team of 11 product managers, Ben is a step removed from managing the actual product at Venmo. Instead, he&#8217;s managing the PMs responsible for different slivers of their product. The thing is, <strong>managing other PMs can get <em>messy</em></strong> since PMs will undoubtedly have their own opinions on how the product should work.</p>
<p class="p1">Our CEO <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji/" target="_blank">Latif Nanji</a></strong> sits down with Ben to discuss how he navigates the messiness of managing all these PMs. <span style="font-weight: 400;">How does he provide guidance versus micromanaging? How does he balance being process-oriented and progress-oriented? And how does a product team lead handle hard decisions? It&#8217;s a conversation that&#8217;s beneficial not only to product team leads, but also any PMs looking to understand their leads more.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Ben, welcome to the podcast.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Thanks for having me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Can you tell our audience a little about your background, and what you do at a Venmo?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I am Head of Product at Venmo, which means a lot of different things. But before that I worked at a company called Braintree, which does credit card processing online. And I joined very early on. I think I was the seventh or eighth developer that joined Braintree, and did a bunch of different things from purely technical roles, to product roles, to hybrid roles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I do now at Venmo is I manage the product management team. I report to the GM, or the CEO of Venmo, and I&#8217;m really responsible for the roadmap, and strategy, and what we&#8217;re doing next. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: As Head of Product, can you tell us a little bit about your team? How many product managers do you have, and what does the structure of the team look like?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah. We have about 11 product managers. And the way the team structure works is we try as hard as we can to focus the organization around product development, product engineering and design. Our organizations have the same structure. We organize these cross-functional teams of PMs, designers and engineers together. My team is organized in roughly three groups. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One that&#8217;s around our internal tools for our customer support team. One that&#8217;s focused on our app experience, like using the Venmo app, signing up, managing your funding sources. And one that&#8217;s focused on where we&#8217;re going next, which we call commerce. But it&#8217;s using Venmo to pay for things in-store and online. Each one of those teams has a lead that manages around one to two PMs.`</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I noticed that you had primarily a development background before coming into this role. Is that true? And how has that influenced your role as Head of Product?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Yeah, I definitely had mostly a development background, but how I got into development at all was an interesting windy road. I went to pretty much art school, and mostly wanted to build things. At that time, the wave of UX and information architecture and user-centric design was getting really popular, and I was very into that. And I just kept getting frustrated that I couldn&#8217;t build things, and make them happen. So, I got more and more into engineering. I saw my job at Braintree as me learning the craft, so, that I could understand it more, so then I could go on to actually figure out what to build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And one of the cool things that happened at Braintree. So, Braintree, the real product is in API. A lot of what I focused on for the majority of my time there was what we called the developer experience team. While I was technical, I was doing a lot of what I now consider product work today. Understanding our users, who these developers are, what they might need, and how we can build products to best serve their needs. I cut my teeth on a very, very technical product.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And now, moving into Venmo, I think for PMs, it&#8217;s always good to have a depth somewhere. Whether it&#8217;s you have more of a business mind and have an MBA, or really understand stats. Or maybe you have more of someone like me, who has more of a developer mind, and can understand how things might be built. Or maybe more of a design mind and understand how the interfaces might work, and how users would interact with it. I think it&#8217;s useful for you to have depth in one of those areas, but interest in all three.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think my depth in engineering is certainly a strength in some areas. Weakness in others. But it&#8217;s served me well, especially with Venmo, considering payments is still a very technical problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Definitely agree about having one area of depth: design, technical, or business. I wanted to switch gears and talk about the messiness of managing product managers. How</span></strong><strong><span class="s1"> have you managed a top-down product strategy versus a bottoms up? And what that looks like for you and your team?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben: </strong>Whatever company you&#8217;re in, you&#8217;re going to have a mix of things that are fully bottoms-up, where you let a team go off, identify a problem, research a solution and then execute that solution. But there&#8217;s also a lot of places where you&#8217;ll have something, maybe a compliance risk, or a, &#8220;Hey, we need to hit these numbers for us to make the quarter, or to get that next round of funding.&#8221; Those things just happen, and that&#8217;s life. And I think the difference between a good PM and a great PM is someone who can then figure out how to take that, and look at it as constraints. And constraints inspire creativity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What I see my role as is how do I help these PMs best approach it that way. Where it&#8217;s like, we have this compliance project that&#8217;s coming down the pipe that we just have to make happen in this timeframe because of regulatory pressure. Managing this PM who&#8217;s ultimately responsible for hitting these dates and dealing with this compliance issue, I ask how do we look at this? What is the user problem we&#8217;re solving here? Or what is the thing we&#8217;re going to do, and how are we going to take this as an opportunity to make things a lot better?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let&#8217;s take an example at Braintree. The credit card industry as a whole changed some rules, which would have made it much more difficult for businesses that use Braintree to comply to those rules, without significant amount of work. That was a big constraint we had coming down the pipe. And the team that I was managing at the time actually found this amazing creative solution to it that not only satisfied that constraint, but it just made adding Braintree to businesses way, way, way easier. And that was a perfect example of what I&#8217;m trying to explain here, which is they took this annoying constraint, and turned it into this huge value for the user. That allowed a lot more businesses to, one, be more secure, and also just add Braintree faster, which is always better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It&#8217;s all about guiding those PMs into finding what are we really going to do here? It&#8217;s not just about checking the box of this top-down priority. It&#8217;s about understanding the whole problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Very cool. You mentioned something in there that caught my attention, which was that constraints create creativity. Can you talk about an example of where you&#8217;ve created constraints that produced a greater result to the end user?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> An easy answer that comes to mind is organizational structure. Separating responsibilities of teams is by definition creating artificial constraints. Where we&#8217;re saying, like, &#8220;Hey, I need you to just focus and become an expert of this area.&#8221; That idea of trying to find the right seams to split up your organization. Take Venmo for instance, understanding the application experience and using the app. We think that constraint will allow you to just go very deep in that, and find really interesting stalls for our users. Whereas, just letting things happen more project-based, then we would never sit down and have someone deeply understand how you manage funding sources, credit cards and banks in your Venmo account. That deep understanding will help us identify much more interesting problems that we can solve for our users.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Have you used time as a constraint before?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I view deadlines often much more as a tool that the team can use themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I usually encourage teams to set deadlines for themselves—I think that&#8217;s really useful. It&#8217;s a great way to keep them accountable, but I always find that it&#8217;s best to let them do that, not me. I mean, of course there are situations that happen where there is an external deadline. When that happens I think it&#8217;s best to all accept that, &#8220;Hey, regulatory set this deadline.  A client set this deadline. We have to hit it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I generally found that if I artificially set deadlines, that skews too much into micromanagement. Then you have the reverse problem of creating an artificial constraint, and it actually reduces creativity because the teams feel less autonomous, and less engaged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I think that makes sense to let the teams set their own deadlines. One of the exercises sometimes I like to push forward is, especially on the design teams, is let&#8217;s come up with a list of things that we could do that we would be able implement in the next two week cycle in development. Or something that fosters the idea of Pareto&#8217;s law of 80/20, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily come up with the full solution, but at least takes a bite out of the apple.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I firmly believe the goal we all have is to create super engaged creative teams. And I think the biggest ingredient you need to do that is autonomy. You can just go run. Solve this really interesting problem however you want to, but there is that balance of how do you make sure they&#8217;re being pragmatic, and not overly perfectionist about it. Yeah, I think stuff like that I would generally describe it as time boxing. To say, &#8220;We can&#8217;t spend forever ideating on what we want to do here. Let&#8217;s pick the best thing we can do, and move forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: And have you found that&#8217;s been an issue with respect to managing your strategy? Saying this is the problem we need to solve, here&#8217;s the time box. Have you seen teams maybe take longer or go off the rails in other directions you weren&#8217;t expecting?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Definitely. Generally though when I reflect on those situations, there are a lot of things that I realize I should have done differently. That&#8217;s where I think a huge part of my job is setting expectations. Saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the problem you want to solve. Here are the guardrails.&#8221; If I set a really generic problem of we want to make money at Venmo, people can take that in any direction. So, I think it&#8217;s more we want to focus on specific aspects and here are further guardrails to help you focus. Setting that upfront is absolutely key, and also setting the level of urgency of we want to come up with a good solution, but we&#8217;re looking to see an impact in the next couple quarters versus the next couple years, versus the next couple weeks. All are very different things, and the more you just talk about that up front, I think everything goes much more smoothly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: What other guard rails besides time do you use? Are there other qualitative or quantitative factors that help the cadence and structure? What do those guardrails look like to you as a product leader?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think scope might be the other big one. For instance, we needed to make some changes. We had a top-down thing come down where we need to make some changes in the way we add bank accounts to Venmo. There were a lot of questions of could we rethink the way payment methods work overall at Venmo? Can we make it more dynamic? There&#8217;s all these things we can do that would impact the full experience. And I thought it&#8217;s awesome that you&#8217;re thinking about that, but we need to put some scope here.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Saying some of this is out of scope and finding that balance. I don&#8217;t ever want to just say, do this and check this box and move on. There always needs to be room for that creativity. But asking how do we improve the overall experience of adding the bank account makes perfect sense. Maybe you expand that out to how you would also add a credit card too, or a debit card. Like those are all very related things. Let&#8217;s focus there, but going all the way out to how payment methods work throughout the whole Venmo experience, feels too big. Let&#8217;s keep it a little more contained. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s probably another place where there&#8217;s negotiation. Usually what I like to do is let the PM go off and just think creatively about this, no restrictions. And then let&#8217;s sit down and talk about it and agree upon those guardrails. And then we&#8217;ll move forward. That always usually goes well. People respond poorly when you enforce constraints right away. I think everyone appreciates when we&#8217;re given time to think about it, we had a discussion, we agreed upon a compromise and we moved forward. That always feels really good and collaborative. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: And there&#8217;s also this concept where you might end up providing guidance versus maybe getting a little bit to close to the situation and micromanaging. How have you managed that balance and trade-off ? How have you incorporated that into your own management style?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Some of this is less about managing PMs specifically and just being a good manager. Where it&#8217;s understanding what I need. Being very clear with each person I manage of here&#8217;s what I need. This is what I need to make sure I&#8217;m doing my job well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But then also letting them say, &#8220;This is what I need from you to do my job well.&#8221; Certain PMs want to talk every day, orwant to talk constantly and make sure that we&#8217;re all in sync. Where other PMs might be like, &#8220;I got this, let&#8217;s just agree to check in at key points, and we&#8217;ll move forward.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So understanding what people want is a key step and setting those expectations early I think helps a lot. I try as hard as I can not to solve problems. Instead, I try to help people identify problems. Whenever you get into solving problems, that&#8217;s where you get dangerously close to micromanaging. And of course, I&#8217;ve crossed that line probably more times than I would have liked, but I generally have a principle of asking how can I make sure that I&#8217;m just helping them identify the right problems and we have the same context. Those have always served me well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And then when I inevitably cross that line and go to deep into solutions, trying to just step back and admit that I made that mistake and try to move forward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting one. It seems counterintuitive to say that solving problems with your team members is micromanaging and product management. Because in another department, whether it&#8217;s marketing or even a design lead coming in and solving a difficult design problem, we wouldn&#8217;t consider that micromanaging. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"> Do you find that there are a lot more individual contributors in your product organization? How much autonomy do you give to one PM versus another? I just ask this question simply because of the fact that I&#8217;ve always been of the opinion, I want a PM to run horizontal across the whole company.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think you and I are very aligned on that. I generally think of it as a good thing to let the PMs run and take ownership. I mean, we would sometimes internally say it&#8217;s like the mini CEO of that area. Marty Kagan said something like, “Product is a huge feeder into CEO-type roles.&#8221; Seeing what I&#8217;m now dealing with every day for the last the couple of years of just managing PMs, it&#8217;s a very CEO-type role, where you want to encourage your team to do more and want to be the coach. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> If you step in and do too much, you don&#8217;t get the talent, creativity and power you need. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Absolutely, I think that&#8217;s the transition in my career going from product to CEO. I pick and choose one battle a quarter I think for about a day and get in the weeds with product, so I make sure that I&#8217;m still close to some of the stuff that they&#8217;re working on. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How have you managed to delegate, but keep yourself informed and stay accountable to the people that you report to? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think this is where I actually spend a lot of my time thinking about process. Which is weird for me because I&#8217;m someone who maybes hates process. I generally think I want to get back to that mode where you&#8217;re just a really small group of people in a garage doing great work. And it always feels like process is a little bit like red tape. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Process is the glue that allows me to empower autonomy, but still make sure I&#8217;m doing my job well and that Venmo is moving in the right direction. When I say process, first of all, I don&#8217;t mean Jira or stuff like that. Those things are important, but I mean more about how do you communicate? When do you talk? And what do you talk about?</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So I spend a lot of time thinking about how do we have just enough and just the right amount of meetings to make sure that we&#8217;re in sync and talking regularly. But not enough where it feels like everyday the PMs are constantly giving status updates and meetings. Of course, I don&#8217;t want to do that. So what I&#8217;ve found is, and you just said this about how you try to once a quarter dig in with the teams. Every week, I try to sit down with the engineering lead, product lead, design lead, for each area and get them to walk me through everything that&#8217;s going on. Just to make sure that I have in my mind what&#8217;s happening. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We also try to do regular reviews, where at any key point, any PM can say, &#8220;Hey, I want to get in front of the leadership team to say here&#8217;s where we are on this project. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re thinking about. Here are the problems we have.&#8221; And I think that cadence allows us to get in front of a lot of things and allows myself, and like you said before, all the other stakeholders feel comfortable with what&#8217;s going on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So I think regular communication is key. I think it&#8217;s easy to say it&#8217;s regular communication. Why I say process, not just communication, is it&#8217;s actually agreed upon to have some actual cadence of communication. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: What would be the last process you saw in Venmo&#8217;s product team that just absolutely fall flat on its face and what did you do to solve it?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> One of the things we&#8217;ve been trying to do is get more disciplined about having artifacts of where we&#8217;re at. Maybe like showing our roadmap, which is kind of ironic considering who I&#8217;m talking to right now. We used probably what you all probably know a lot about which is the simple way to do it, just a spreadsheet that we kept updated. That crashed and burned pretty hard because I think we got into this world where I was asking these PMs to update this spreadsheet every week and it wasn&#8217;t clear why they were doing it and what value we got out of it. Because looking at just the status updates wasn&#8217;t very useful. Really it was about having that discussion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think it was doing that and then almost watching that go for a few weeks and realizing this isn&#8217;t really adding value. The PMs just see it as busy work, the leadership team really doesn&#8217;t care about looking at every single project every week, they just care about hot topics. I almost thought of it like the process itself was a product that I was managing where the iteration was how do we solve both &#8220;users problems.&#8221; Leadership is one user, the PM team is another, and the thing that they both actually wanted to do is talk about hot topics. So we have this leadership review where every week we have this standing hour which is a time slot where all the leadership teams are in one spot and any PM can come in and share whether it&#8217;s, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re about to launch a project. Here&#8217;s all the information about it.&#8221; Or maybe, &#8220;Hey, we just did a bunch of research and we&#8217;re about to start implementing. Here&#8217;s all that research. Let&#8217;s talk about any feedback you have.&#8221; That has become way more valuable for the leadership team and the PM team than just updating a spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I love that idea. I think that is an incredible way to get great conversation. I like the framing of hot topics. How often do you have it? Are there 15 minute time slots? How many people are traditionally in the room? Give us some color and flavor as to how this all came to be and what things are working well and what things probably you&#8217;d like to see improved.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think the one thing that has really organically come into focus from that meeting is it&#8217;s all about what are the hardest and messiest and scariest problems of any project. There are the things that you&#8217;re most worried about with any given project and this meeting has turned into a forum where we almost always lead with that. We&#8217;re about to launch this big new feature. What&#8217;s the one thing that keeps you up at night about it, and what are you doing about it, and what can we all do about it? I think that framing has created so much clarity so quickly about what&#8217;s going on. It might be, &#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s this big problem. I&#8217;m really worried about it, but I think we got it. We&#8217;re okay right now.&#8221; And even then, it&#8217;s so valuable for myself and the rest of the leadership team because then we know what to watch out for. If we see any updates that are about this thing, we know to really dig in and understand what&#8217;s going on versus something else that might not be as important.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think that&#8217;s a guiding principle that has helped us a lot. The attendance of the meeting is something I think we&#8217;re going to iterate a lot on. Right now, my goal is to keep it as small as possible because it&#8217;s all about how do you have those discussions and really dig in and talk and collaborate. Sometimes with these type of meetings, they go into a phase where there&#8217;s just so many people there that it&#8217;s almost more of a presentation and that&#8217;s not really the point of that meeting. The point is to really dig in and talk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So right now, it&#8217;s just the leadership team. What that means is the PM, the designer, the tech lead. But really all the engineers could come. That usually doesn&#8217;t happen just because they&#8217;re too focused on other things. But the goal is the team that&#8217;s working on something and the leadership team, discussing in-depth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">With respect to balancing process and progress, have you noticed which processes may have impacted progress? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think the one other area—this is really the nitty gritty—that I think we&#8217;ve struggled with trying to find the right balance of is how do you just do the normal ceremonies of agile development? So, stand ups, no problem, but where I think sprint planning and backlog grooming has actually been something that we&#8217;ve struggled with a lot. Because one of the things that Venmo has is a pretty big team, but we&#8217;re ultimately all delivering just this app—which is a very small footprint. That means that we have the iOS app and the Android app and web app. So how do we make sure that for any given change, we&#8217;re coordinating changes across all of those platforms? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Whenever we have one of these teams, it&#8217;s like we have these little sub-teams. We have an Android team, we have an iOS team, we have a web team. So what we&#8217;ve been trying to figure out is how do you do the right level of backlog grooming and sprint planning? Do you get all the engineers? I think the traditional way to do this is to just get the whole team. All the engineers, the designers, the PM, all together, look at the backlog, and decide what you&#8217;re going to do and move forward. But that&#8217;s been hard because you have iOS engineers and Android engineers who really just have no context of what&#8217;s happening in the back end or vice versa. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, I think we&#8217;ve inhibited and isolated between these two extremes of having everyone on the delivery team really have simple sets of meetings, versus having maybe two to three different backlog grooming sessions where the PM has to go to all of them just to make sure that all the teams are in sync. I don&#8217;t know if we know what the right answer is there yet, but that&#8217;s certainly been another place where we&#8217;ve iterated a lot of our process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Can you talk about your product management meetings, just with your product managers? Do you have those types of meetings and what do they look like? Where do you find the most value in them, and what have you learned?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> So I think the one meeting that we&#8217;ve iterated on a few times and it&#8217;s now starting to feel very good is something we call the product leads meeting. At the beginning, I outlined the organizational structure for the product team at Venmo, but really there are three people that are the leaders in each of these areas and they all report to me. The four of us meet weekly, and that meeting I view as we&#8217;re the product team of Venmo. We&#8217;re tasked with making sure we&#8217;re investing our most valuable resource correctly, which is our engineering and design teams&#8217; time. Are we happy with that? The way we answer that is quickly going over here are all the things we have in flight, how much time and effort we&#8217;re investing in those, and here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on in the market. Here&#8217;s key data that we&#8217;re looking at.</span>Here are our key OKRs for the overall business, and are we tracking well against them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"Process is the glue that allows me to empower autonomy, but still make sure I’m doing my job well."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Process%20is%20the%20glue%20that%20allows%20me%20to%20empower%20autonomy%2C%20but%20still%20make%20sure%20I%E2%80%99m%20doing%20my%20job%20well.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3969' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">One of the problems I&#8217;ve always seen organizations struggle with is they start to transition from a really small startup team into a bigger organization—which is definitely happening at Venmo right now—is you get too much siloing. You&#8217;ll have one team that&#8217;s doing great but they don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s happening around them. So this meeting with these leads allows the app experience lead to say, &#8220;Oh, wow. I hadn&#8217;t been thinking about how our business involvement is changing.&#8221; Sharing that context through data and actual key results we&#8217;re looking at has been incredibly valuable for the product leaders across Venmo.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> For the product team itself, we&#8217;re still iterating a lot. Right now, we&#8217;re trying something out that we&#8217;re calling the product critique meeting. It&#8217;s another meeting where it&#8217;s the whole product team and a PM will present and go through a narrative they wrote, or they&#8217;ll go through a design sprint they led, or go through a research plan they&#8217;re about to take off. The goal of it is 1) to still share context and let any PM across the company know that this being  worked on and 2) it&#8217;s a place for us to critique each other and push each other and find ways to improve as a product team overall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s been really interesting. We just started that, so we&#8217;ll see if that lasts or crashes and burns. I think I&#8217;m very excited about that because it&#8217;s a great way for us to grow as a product team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: What would you say is the number one thing heads of products should do to contain the messiness of managing other PMs?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I think the biggest thing that they should do is over-communicate at the start. Talk more at the start. It feels counterintuitive because I think it&#8217;s that whole micromanaging thing again. I don&#8217;t want to try to talk about; I want to just trust people are smart and are going to do the right thing. But I&#8217;ve always found being way more up front about expectations and saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the scope of this project,&#8221; or, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the way I need you to give me updates on status,&#8221; or, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I want to dig in with you&#8221;. Doing that up front just smooths everything over. And then, most importantly, having that actually be a conversation two-ways where it&#8217;s, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I want&#8221; and listening to what they want, makes everything go much smoother. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Very cool. The last question, and this one&#8217;s much more important, is, when is Venmo being introduced into Canada?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> I can&#8217;t speak to any future product plans right now!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Latif:</strong> <strong>Whenever you&#8217;re planning on coming to Canada and introducing your products here, we welcome you guys with open arms.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ben:</span></strong><span class="s1"> Fantastic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Ben, where can our audience find you online?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> You can find me on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/benemills" target="_blank">@benemills</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Thank you so much Benjamin for being on the podcast.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Ben:</strong> Thank you very much.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">And the podcast for / by product people is on a roll, with episode four of <strong><a href="https://hubs.ly/H0bTHKq0" target="_blank">Product to Product</a>&#8216;s second season</strong>!</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to the episode below:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/product-to-product/id1293415837?mt=2" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-4037 alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-apple.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a><a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Is7ibqzwhkqszuin6l2li7f3in4" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4036 size-full alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-google.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="//html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/6540191/height/90/theme/custom/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/yes/preload/no/no_addthis/no/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/32c7c0/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">As we continue to explore <strong>the human side of product</strong> this season, we have not one, but two awesome product people on this episode sharing their real-world stories of navigating the human-related aspects of the product space. This episodes features two members of <strong><a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank">Intercom</a></strong>&#8216;s product team: Director of Product Management, <strong><a href="https://ie.linkedin.com/in/brian-donohue-2450192" target="_blank">Brian Donohue</a></strong>, and Senior Product Manager, <strong><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michellefitzpatrick" target="_blank">Michelle Fitzpatrick</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Having both joined Intercom back when it was ~30 employees, Brian and Michelle both have plenty of experience making tough, yet successful, product decisions for their users. However, they know that sometimes the data says one thing, while your gut says something else. </span></p>
<p>So our CEO <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji/" target="_blank">Latif Nanji</a></strong> interviews the two product veterans about what to do in these ambiguous situations. Can you trust your gut <em>that </em>much to make the right decision for your user? Brian and Michelle explain how a PM can &#8220;<strong>build their own gut</strong>&#8220;—or what they refer to as <strong>product conviction</strong>—so that they can make confident gut-based decisions in unclear scenarios.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Michelle and Brian, thank you for coming on the podcast.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Thank you for having us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, great to be here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Can you tell us a bit about yourselves and what you do at Intercom?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I&#8217;ll go first. </span>I&#8217;m Michelle Fitzpatrick. <span class="s1">I&#8217;m a product manager here at Intercom. I joined around the same time as Brian, just a little over four years ago. And over my time, I&#8217;ve worked across a bunch of different product teams at Intercom. I started on a more back-end team, working on our API and integrations with different products and services that our customers use alongside Intercom. And then over the years I started working more on the inbox part of Intercom, which is the place where teams see and reply to conversations with our customers. So I worked on that for a couple years, alongside with our mobile apps. And right now I&#8217;m working on building out the features that we need for sales teams using Intercom to talk to leads, and to convert them on their website.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> And I&#8217;m Brian, so Michelle and I probably started two weeks or a month apart, four years ago. So in Intercom terms, we&#8217;re old-timers. I&#8217;ve worked, actually mostly across the messenger, and then more recently across multiple teams. But the messenger always seems to be where I go back to. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Yeah, we&#8217;re big users of Intercom over at Roadmunk, so very familiar with those product lines. Today&#8217;s conversation is around product conviction. So I wanted to start with you Brian. If you could talk a little bit about what you mean by product conviction?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, I think this is a theme that Michelle and I had been chatting about on and off over the last couple months. When there&#8217;s ambiguity is when you most need product conviction. Product conviction is the courage to fight for something when things are harder to justify; having that belief to actually see it through. Sometimes it&#8217;s really easy to have product conviction. There&#8217;s a clear problem. It&#8217;s your top customer request. It&#8217;s very straightforward what this thing is. And product conviction comes quite easily, the whole team gets it. Where it gets interesting, is when ambiguity creeps in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And then you can say, &#8220;Geez, there are 15 different things we could do here.&#8221; They all seem valuable. How do they choose? Or when you go into spaces that are a little more speculative. This feels like an opportunity. This feels like something that could be really impactful. But there&#8217;s lots of ambiguity there. And I think that&#8217;s where it gets more interesting and harder. You have to say, &#8220;How do you get that product conviction to drive through that ambiguity?&#8221;</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s actually a few different levels that you can have your product conviction at. One is a very high level of, &#8220;Where are we taking this product in the next year, two years, five years.&#8221; You need to have this conviction that you&#8217;re bringing the product in a direction that you think is valuable, and it&#8217;s the right direction to go on. But then that goes all the way down into, as you&#8217;re planning out your roadmap, your next set of things that you&#8217;re going to tackle. And then all the way down into individual decisions that you have to make day-to-day when you have to make trade-offs, and to have the confidence and conviction in knowing that we should do X and Y. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Definitely agree with that. It sounds like you guys have a lot of conviction, based on how long you guys have been at Intercom. Did you guys start with that kind of conviction, and how did it evolve throughout your experiences and roles as a product manager at Intercom?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> It&#8217;s very definitely no. </span><span class="s1">I did not start with that conviction. It would be really worrisome if someone came into a job and had a really strong conviction. Because you&#8217;d say, &#8220;What the fuck? How do you have this strong of an opinion yet?&#8221; Because it&#8217;s so hard to get a framework and get a sense. I think you can have speculative conviction on things, and you can have opinions that you can casually throw around. But conviction is where you actually think this thing is right, not just like, &#8220;Hey, now here&#8217;s my quick reaction to it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think one concept that Michelle and I talk about a lot is building your gut. And that&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t start a new job, start with a new product, and immediately come in with conviction, because you&#8217;ve got to build your gut. You&#8217;ve got to build this product sense. And eventually it turns into intuition. But it&#8217;s really based on a whole bunch of experience there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Totally. And I think that&#8217;s where Intercom came from. So the idea for having this messenger in the product, it wasn&#8217;t just a spark of an idea that came to the founders of Intercom. It came from a real need that they had. They had another product they were using, and they just kept running into this problem over and over. They couldn&#8217;t see or talk to the people using the product. And this idea for building this whole company, this product, this whole product category, that came from a real problem that they had. It didn&#8217;t just come out of nowhere. It came from a real need that built up over time, and they had this gut feeling that, &#8220;Now this is what we need to do.&#8221; They closed up their other company, and then they focused on building Intercom. And they have the conviction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> And I think what&#8217;s interesting there, is the easiest conviction is when it&#8217;s your problem. Because then you know it, and then of course you&#8217;ve got conviction. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling the pain of this. I&#8217;m feeling the absence of this.&#8221; And often that&#8217;s where most new ideas come from, is when someone feels that pain firsthand. Like Basecamp, back when they were 37signals, they talk about continuing to want to be building based on what they knew, so they could rely on that. Most reliable product conviction is when you&#8217;re solving your own problem. And then it gets continually harder the further out you go from where, is this actually your problem or how removed you are from that actual problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I have to agree as a founder myself, our problem of roadmapping was borne out of me trying to do it for two years in Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint. One thing I wanted to touch on is how do you get your product management teams or new PMs that may not be fully exposed to this problem, to start building their gut? Are there exercises you put them through to help accelerate their ability to build their gut?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> So we have a lot of internal processes and ways of working that. We have a whole doc for how we build and set roadmaps. And a lot of things in that talks about all the different sources for defining your roadmap, such as the most common request that your customers in your product area have. Looking at the data and usage of the features of the product area that you own. Talking to the sales team about what&#8217;s blocking customers from using that part of the product, looking at competitors, and looking at industry trends. And because they&#8217;re all the sources of our roadmap that we all look to to influence and decide what we should build, new folks who join the team start looking to all these sources as well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So they&#8217;ll look at, what we call our customer voice report, and this is the most common things that our customers are asking us for in a product area. So we&#8217;ll get them to look at that. We&#8217;ll get them to talk with our sales team. We get people to do a customer day. So they join our customer support team for a day and they understand what our customers are asking for. And all of those things are just really important to help them build an insight into the different lenses that you need to look at our product through.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Michelle, you recently switched from one product area to a new part, serving a new use case. And the first thing you did, because you didn&#8217;t know that use case, was, you just sat in on customer interviews. It builds up the logic and the rationale. But conviction rarely comes from those, unless there&#8217;s a narrative that&#8217;s very clear. And you can look at this analysis, and it&#8217;s very clear and everyone gets onboard. But so much of this I think needs that very human interaction of talking to people, of seeing them demonstrate this thing here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Which basically comes down to empathy I think. You can&#8217;t fake product conviction for something. You need to connect the dot to some specific anecdote. And even though in some ways that is terrible, because then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;It&#8217;s just an anecdote, how do we know it&#8217;s real?&#8221; But you have other ways to validate it. But that anecdote gives that taste in your mouth of this thing matters. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, sometimes a customer will describe a problem in a certain way that you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Got it.&#8221; Now I really get it in the way that will just carry you through. And then you&#8217;ll hear other customers talk about the same sort of problem in different ways. And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, no, no, I know what you mean. Don&#8217;t worry, because I talked to this customer who explained it to me very clearly, and it clicked with me.&#8221; And then you&#8217;ll use other sources to make sure to ask, &#8220;Is this representative? Do other customers feel this, and is this something worth solving?&#8221; But a lot of times you&#8217;ll get those little spark moments when you talk with customers, and things will just click. And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I really understand this now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> It&#8217;s the same from a researcher&#8217;s perspective of sharing a user test report with people, and even sharing video clips, is nothing like being closer to human interaction, and experiencing it. If you watch a couple of user tests, you walk out saying, &#8220;Oh shit, we got to fix this thing,&#8221; right? Whereas if you read about it you say, &#8220;Yeah. but there are these other things.&#8221; But if you felt it, if you experienced it, that&#8217;s what gives you the drive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes you don&#8217;t need it, because things are more straightforward. But there are certain times when there&#8217;s ambiguity and it&#8217;s harder than you expected to build this thing. Then it&#8217;s so critical to have that conviction to motivate the team, and actually motivate yourself. We need to fight for this; this thing matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Has there been an example where your gut has been really successful? And possibly one where it has not been successful and you&#8217;ve had to readjust it and perhaps use data to get back on track?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Let&#8217;s start with the more successful one which was emoji. And this will give a sense of how quickly things move on. So emojis were a thing three years ago and started to get pretty widespread in consumer messaging apps, but in the business world were still a new thing (maybe Slack had just started with them). It was right at that transition where it still was broadly, &#8220;Oh no, businesses don&#8217;t talk to customers with emoji.&#8221; Our VP of product, Paul Adams came and said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got to bring emojis in. We&#8217;ve got to do this.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I distinctly remember at the time, as a PM thinking, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ve got all these important problems we&#8217;re trying to work through and you want me to frickin&#8217; bring in emojis here?&#8221; Because it felt like, it wasn&#8217;t solving any problems. No, there&#8217;s no customer who wrote in and said, &#8220;Guys, you know if you did emojis, I&#8217;d pay you loads more money. You know that&#8217;s what&#8217;s stopping me from giving you more money.&#8221; No one said this. And Paul, he actually had a really good articulation for it. He talked about, this is actually making making internet business personal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So much of communication is non-verbal, and emoji actually enables some of this non-verbal communication, and they&#8217;re what actually enables better communication. He actually had a quite a strong rationale for it, which I think is important. But most importantly he had the product conviction that this matters. This thing matters in what we&#8217;re trying to do. And so he basically stopped a lot of work that was going on because it wasn&#8217;t on there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> And he also had conviction that the timing was now. We needed to do it now to get ahead of the curve here, rather than behind it. So that was like one that stood out, that in retrospect is like, that&#8217;s in all our marketing material everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> That&#8217;s one that even still afterwards is so hard to measure the success of. You could go measure, and we have, how many times people use an emoji, and what are the most common emojis that people use. But it&#8217;s not about counting the usage of this. Using those emojis transforms the way people are communicating. </span></p>
<p class="p1">We sense that in gifts in Intercom. So businesses and customers can send gifts to each other. And you look through, and you read some conversations, and they start with a very simple, &#8220;I have a question,&#8221; or, &#8220;I have problem.&#8221; And then as you read through, by the end the customer and the support rep are sending each other back and forth, emojis and gifts, and they&#8217;re having this great relationship.</p>

<p class="p1">By the end of it, the customer is left feeling with a really great feeling at the end that this person understands them, they helped them solve the problem. And that&#8217;s a really hard thing to measure. You can&#8217;t quantify that better feeling that you can have with that intangible improved communication.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Small start ups, they&#8217;d be thinking the same way we would. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah this is great, we&#8217;ll use these right away.&#8221; But for a lot of companies this is like, &#8220;Whoa, whoa, this isn&#8217;t part of how we&#8217;re talking to our customers. This is not how we do it.&#8221; And so it needs conviction in light of that resistance of saying, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t solving an immediate problem you&#8217;re telling us to have, but we think this is actually a better product that you&#8217;ll actually evolve to start using.&#8221; The hardest and riskiest product conviction is in the face of resistance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Let&#8217;s see, so what&#8217;s a negative one? Something that we&#8217;ve come close a couple times and never gotten fully over is video messaging. And this is in a similar vein of something that we believe will happen. We believe in the power of this. It&#8217;s not no one is asking for it. But it&#8217;s still speculative. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think this is one where, there&#8217;s lots of internal belief in this. We&#8217;ve had projects there, but we&#8217;ve lacked strong enough conviction given the effort to really push this through over the line, and be willing to fight a long road for adoption there. So I think that&#8217;s one where we haven&#8217;t quite had enough conviction to really prioritize that among the other things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ve had a couple false starts on this. I think we&#8217;ve tried it twice fully; put effort into it. And both times we learned a ton doing it, about what video is good for, and what it&#8217;s not. I think we know where we want to go with video at some point, but this is one that the effort to do it, I don&#8217;t think we have enough conviction that now is the right time on this one for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> We&#8217;ll change our minds next week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> We will get there! But yeah, video is along the lines of emoji and gifts. Like we know it&#8217;s another format that people can communicate in, and that&#8217;s our wheelhouse. That&#8217;s what we think about and work on all the time. And we know it&#8217;s definitely going to happen much more in business communication. We&#8217;re looking at ways to incorporate it in setting up video calls, and we have a new meeting scheduler. But having  video through the messenger in Intercom, it&#8217;s something that we want to do and will do at some point. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> But if you think of it, no one&#8217;s had strong enough conviction to really fight for it. Because it&#8217;s needed it. Because there are so many reasons not to do it, and it&#8217;s hard to do. In the face of lots of resistance, do you have conviction to push something through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, and we&#8217;ve tried this before. I think one of the tough things is for video, the bar is so high. People expect a perfect seamless video call. Like Google Hangouts can barely do it. Even Skype, if there&#8217;s a blip, people get really frustrated. You can&#8217;t sort of do it,—like an 80/20 rule in video. You need to really put the engineering horse fire behind it to make sure that this actually works. And that&#8217;s something we haven&#8217;t been able to push through yet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: One of the things that product conviction led product organization sometimes have trouble with, is a lot of people in the rest of the organization don&#8217;t necessarily have all of that information locked up in their gut. So how have you guys found a way to communicate this organizationally, so that people understand a bit better how you are making decisions and prioritizing what&#8217;s important to be built in the product?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> When you&#8217;re smaller you can get away with less rationale and more quick chats that actually convince people of it. As you get bigger, it&#8217;s more of a burden to bring other people around the company onboard. So as you get bigger, product conviction is not enough. You have to have a rationale for it. And you have to be able to back it up. Usually, like Michelle was talking about this earlier, your product conviction should come from somewhere. Frequently you actually forget where it came from, you can&#8217;t remember the signals, and you have to go back and retrace your steps, to almost recreate that narrative again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But I do think, you need product conviction alongside the rationale. But sometimes you can also just have a superficial rationale that sounds good, but you don&#8217;t really believe in it. And that can easily happen. I think you really need both.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, and I think there are two levels. Around the company it&#8217;s become more important to be more structured and a little more formalized in how we&#8217;re communicating these things. Especially as we work across multiple offices. But then also with your team that are building things. So with the engineers and designers that you work with each day, lots of times they won&#8217;t be in all the conversations or the interviews that I might be sitting in on. And it&#8217;s my job to make sure that I convey enough information to them so that they also have some product conviction in what they&#8217;re building. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Because both the designers and engineers on the team, they&#8217;ll be making a lot of decisions, they&#8217;ll be inputting into things, they&#8217;ll be making trade-offs themselves without me making a decision for them. And giving them this kind of broader information around the problem, just informs them enough. It equips them to make the decisions themselves in really smart ways. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> As a PM you need to get enough product conviction so you can make sure the rest of the team shares it as well. There&#8217;s nothing worse that a team not believing in what they&#8217;re building and the importance of what they&#8217;re building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Totally, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Do you sometimes think that may lead to group think around new product managers joining the team? How have you combated that, if that&#8217;s an issue at all?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I was thinking much more around the engineers and designers on the team. We don&#8217;t go into a group think or necessarily make decisions by consensus, but we do all discuss a lot of the decisions amongst the team. Like at Intercom, we have quite strong team units that are responsible for certain areas of the product. And it&#8217;s that team&#8217;s job to identify and solve a problem. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The PM is one part of that, but so is the designer, and so are the engineers. Everybody has a role to play in that. Sometimes it&#8217;s the PM&#8217;s job to try and paint the picture of what we need to do and why, and why this is valuable. But then it&#8217;s also on everybody else to also contribute to that, to challenge that, to input their ideas. And then we figure out how we&#8217;re going to solve this problem and ship it to our customers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s also recognizing there are certain times for debate, and then certain times for that disagree and commit. If leadership is fully behind something, there&#8217;s a good track record here. Once there&#8217;s conviction, that gets shared downwards. Like if Des and Paul had all hands, saying here&#8217;s the rationale, here&#8217;s the context, here&#8217;s the why.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So I think so much of this is at all levels of the company, you&#8217;ve got to share that context, and you&#8217;ve got to share that narrative. No one in the company gets away with, &#8220;Oh now, I&#8217;m confident this is right.&#8221; At no level in the company does that work. So I think at all levels you need that narrative, and it&#8217;s so critical to have that narrative to bring everyone in. So they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yes, now I&#8217;m excited by this too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, and to not be questioning what they&#8217;re working on is valuable. You need to make sure that everybody on your team knows what they&#8217;re working on matters, and why it matters. And some things are up for a debate, and some things everyone can have input on. But what you&#8217;re doing and why—that problem that you&#8217;re solving—everybody needs to be onboard that that&#8217;s a valuable thing worth solving. And that&#8217;s on the PM to convey that to the team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I noticed you mentioned a couple of times the concept of disagree and commit. Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys have introduced that? I think that&#8217;s a popular saying from Jeff Bezos if I&#8217;m not mistaken. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> I don&#8217;t know where it originated from; I think it&#8217;s a pretty widely accepted concept at this point. I mean we literally bring it up sometimes in meetings. So if there&#8217;s a contentious debate, and there are heated feelings about it, you need to have the space to air those thoughts, to contribute to the debate. And then you need to have a clear and hopefully quick point, where that debate concludes. And this is where there&#8217;s clarity of who owns this decision, and that person says, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ve heard the points here, this is what we&#8217;re going to do. I know this is a hard decision. I need everyone to get behind me on here.&#8221; And we&#8217;ll literally say, &#8220;We need everyone to disagree and commit.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It&#8217;s not that often that it happens, because usually there are not many that are contentious. So how we&#8217;ve done it, is sometimes we&#8217;ve been very explicit about this is the thing we&#8217;re asking people to do. And I think other times it can be implicit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think it&#8217;s also to be explicit when a decision is made and communicating that, &#8220;The decision&#8217;s made, let&#8217;s move on,&#8221; and not just leave it ambiguous. Because then it just comes up again later. So I think it&#8217;s also about, when you do make this decision that&#8217;s hard, just be really clear about it. Unless we get new information or some big reason to go back and reconsider it, we need to move on, because there&#8217;s something else to do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, the power of decisiveness. Having conviction in it&#8217;s more important to make a decision and get everyone moving forward, than it is to make the absolute right decision. There&#8217;s nothing worse than being in that paralysis of going in circles, of not feeling like you&#8217;re making progress. The most important thing is making progress. You hope you&#8217;re oriented in the right direction, so you don&#8217;t have to re-steer too broadly. But that&#8217;s way more important than making the absolute right decision. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People feel that sense of momentum that comes from constant fast decisions,; that&#8217;s one of the magic things on a team. When the team feels like, &#8220;Oh yeah, each day, each week, we&#8217;re making progress towards this thing. We&#8217;re making hard decisions.&#8221; Then it&#8217;s way easier for people to get behind things so they see the power of just fast decisions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> And the worst is when those decisions aren&#8217;t happening, and you find yourself like two and three weeks later having the same conversation again. The same debate, arguing all the same sides and nobody is just deciding and moving on. You&#8217;re just circling. And that just feels frustrating and draining.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> It zaps all the energy and momentum out, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Absolutely. It reminds me of this expression I heard once, seven out of ten is better than five out of five. Trying to perfect every detail over this long period of time versus just moving forward in progress, and showing that people are learning, has such a great impact on everyone&#8217;s minds and motivation. So I can totally echo that sentiment. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Yeah, o</span><span class="s1">ne other point that we were talking about the other day, it was about the difference in decisions you have to make sometimes, and recognizing them. Some decisions are cheap, and some decisions are expensive. Some you can just make later on, we can change this, we can iterate on it. This isn&#8217;t like an everlasting change in our system that&#8217;s going to be really hard to back out of. And to recognize those quick decisions; just make a call and move on. </span></p>
<p class="p1">And then recognizing that there are other ones that are more fundamental. This may impact our system in large ways. This may result in a huge amount of engineering effort, let&#8217;s make sure we select the details on this. And recognizing the difference of which are worth having a lot of people contribute to, and really thinking about and weighing which ones you just need to make a call and move on. Because sometimes it can be easy to start debating very small decisions in big ways, and that&#8217;s a big time sink.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> As a PM, remove the burden of being right, and just feel the burden of being better. Our goal here is just being better than where we were; making this product better, not right. Because once you feel that burden of being right, you&#8217;re screwed basically. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: For people that may be in organizations that are very fundamentally data-driven and have some conviction, or trying to build up their conviction, what is some advice that you would share that would help foster more product conviction?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> I just talked to someone last week. She was saying her company only—a new start up of two years—just let the product team start talking to customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Really? What?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> I know. And you just forget how companies </span><span class="s1">come from very different places. So I think, for companies coming from this very data-centric world, some of this is really hard to change. It&#8217;s almost like researchers needing to bring the color of customers. You need to bring customers more to the forefront, however that&#8217;s happening. Through having people sit down in interviews. That&#8217;s why I think with the researcher&#8217;s tool kit of getting people closer to customers and getting that empathy away from numbers. You can hear people talk and you can just see that customers are a mile away from where they&#8217;re thinking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Maybe there&#8217;s not a right or wrong, but from our perspective that&#8217;s unforgivable. The most unforgivable sin of a PM is to be far from your customer. So I think that&#8217;s the first thing, is figuring out how to inject the human customer into that conversation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think the companies that are very data-driven, they&#8217;re just using data as the rationale for decisions. I think then it&#8217;s on the PM to start bringing in other rationale. Maybe it&#8217;s gradually. People just want to understand why a decision is being made, and data is their go-to source for making a decision and for believing that it&#8217;s right, and then being able to measure very concretely afterwards. So I think it&#8217;s on PMs to bring in more sources. Yes you might have some data, but maybe we can color this with what customers are saying, or what competitors are doing, or something that you&#8217;re seeing in the industry. And then broadening out, you&#8217;re making your business case, or making your internal case for why you should do something. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Data is one part of it, but you can add a lot more color. And then people will start to see that. Product conviction is not like a light bulb going off that is totally independent from the data. You can add to the data with other sources. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> But you know, if the emphasis is exclusively on data, data becomes a proxy for conviction, or actually replaces it. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;We have no product conviction, we just follow where the data tells us,&#8221; under the belief that somehow data is agnostic to a huge amount of subjectivity itself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Totally. A lot of data is backwardsb looking as well. You&#8217;re only looking at past indicators of what people have done and where the gaps are. And a lot of product decisions are about identifying opportunities, making a bet, taking a leap of faith that if we do this, we&#8217;ll see something happen. And you can&#8217;t always see that by looking backwards into the data. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Sometimes product strategies do include a little more data-driven focus, sometimes they&#8217;re more qualitative. How have you guys looked at product strategy in the context of having an organization that does seem to have a lot more product conviction? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think one thing that&#8217;s definitely changed a lot to influence our strategy is getting more input from our sales team, which we didn&#8217;t have before. A lot of times we were turning to our current customers and talking to them about the problems that they were having with the product. So our sales team, bringing them in a lot more into the discussion is starting to shape some of the future problems that we can solve. So current customers are paying for our product and they want more from it. </span>But finding out the needs of prospective customers that can&#8217;t even buy your product because you&#8217;re missing something so big, that&#8217;s been a really, really enlightening thing.</p>
<p class="p1">Lots of the time, there&#8217;s overlap between what your current customers are asking for and what these prospective customers need. But that&#8217;s one that we started leaning into a lot more. Our sales team that&#8217;s talking to these people, that are understanding their unique business problems that we&#8217;re not meeting, and sharing that insight with us to start shaping some of the things that we should be looking at, that we&#8217;re currently not.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> We want our product strategy to be stable, but we also want it to be willing to adapt quickly. We&#8217;ve only actually written a product strategy across products. I think that only started the end of last year. So we&#8217;re only just getting to the point of articulating a strategy across all of our products. It&#8217;s taken us a while to get to that level of formality, and we have adjusted a lot. But I think in writing it down, of course you could just say no. Like </span><span class="s1">this is a cliché of course, right? </span>PMs have to say no.</p>

<p class="p1">I think we all forget that amazing Apple video from like four years ago, where they said no to a million things. That still is worth playing again—that was genius. And we felt the power at a strategic level of saying no to certain things. Our product is broad, there are so many opportunities for it. It&#8217;s hard not to get excited about those. And we&#8217;ve done that, and prematurely pseudo-invested in something.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here&#8217;s an anecdote. We actually renamed a team I was on three years ago to a new area that we wanted to push for, and then we eventually like three months later had to say, &#8220;We haven&#8217;t don&#8217;t any work in that at all. We&#8217;re still doing this other thing. Our team name is wrong, we need to change it.&#8221; That was an earlier version of us not being able to say no to things, and being too ambitious in what we were doing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think another thing we&#8217;ve started doing is having broader themes of work across multiple teams. I think in the past, each team used to own a piece of the product and set their own roadmap, and they were totally independent from what the other teams were doing, and no teams were really working together. Over the last year we set broader programs of work or themes of work. And having that influence, the work of multiple teams, and by doing that we start building this great momentum that multiple teams are all working and pointing in the same direction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So our customers start really feeling this momentum. They start seeing things coming at them in different directions, and it&#8217;s from multiple teams working on stuff to solve the same problem. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing again this year. We have some broader themes that we&#8217;re trying to get a number of different teams to point towards and work on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> The challenge of when your R&amp;D teams scale, it&#8217;s actually hard to get basically R&amp;D working on the things that&#8217;s most important to the company. Because fundamentally teams will be more locally optimizing things. So that&#8217;s a surprisingly hard org challenge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Awesome guys, this has been an incredible conversation. Where can our audience find you online?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> You can message us on the Intercom messenger. Just ask for Brian and Michelle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Do you guys have Twitter handle you want to share?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think mine is <a href="https://twitter.com/shelliefitz" target="_blank">@shelliefitz</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian: </strong>Yeah, mine&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_donohue" target="_blank">@brian_donohue</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Michelle and Brian, thank you so much for being on the podcast. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michelle:</strong> Thanks for having us!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Brian:</strong> Yeah, thanks. It&#8217;s been a pleasure!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">And we&#8217;re at episode three of <strong><a href="https://hubs.ly/H0bHfk50" target="_blank">Product to Product</a>&#8216;s second season</strong>, a podcast for / by product people!</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to the episode below:</p>

<p class="p1">As we continue to study <strong>the human side of product</strong>, this episode shares a unique spin on the real-world stories of navigating the human-related aspects of the product space. Our featured guest is <a href="http://sanettesloan.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sanette Tanaka Sloan</b></a>, Senior Product Designer at <strong><a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/a/go-deeper" target="_blank">Vox Media</a></strong>. (Our first product designer on the podcast! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)</p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, Sanette joined Vox Media as the design lead for their first ever innovation team. One of the first big projects she was tasked with was designing a voice bot for the Amazon Echo. The project&#8217;s mandate: <strong>change the way Vox Media&#8217;s audience was finding and consuming their news stories.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Stepping into this &#8220;innovator&#8221; design role, Sanette picked up a whole lot while designing an &#8220;invisible&#8221; AI interface. She experienced first-hand how thoughtful AI product design can ultimately have an impact on &#8220;human&#8221; behaviours. So, Sanette gets real with our colleague Eleni about <strong>how to use product design to ultimately influence audience actions</strong>.</p>

<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span>​<span class="s7">Hey, Sanette. How&#8217;s it going?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">It&#8217;s going well. How are you?</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span><span class="s7">I&#8217;m great. Can you start by telling us who are you and what do you do at Vox?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong> </span>​<span class="s7">My name is Sanette Tanaka Sloan and I am a Senior Product Designer on our audience team here at Vox Media. So my team is responsible for our design system and our audience-facing experience across all of our edit networks. So basically, we&#8217;re concerned with how do you read, watch, or otherwise engage with our stories. And I work for Vox Media, which is the parent company of a ton of news brands like Vox, SB Nation, The Verge, Eater, Curbed, Racked. It sums up to about 350 websites. </span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span><span class="s7">I understand that you had a career in journalism before your current career in product design. Can you tell us why you made that transition and how did you make that transition?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​ </strong><span class="s7">Yeah, you&#8217;re correct. I used to be a reporter at the Wall Street Journal. Ever since I was in high school, I was always interested in media and journalism as an industry. In college, I did a ton with our school paper; I was the editor my senior year, I also took photos, I did layout. So I did design and reporting and I really liked being involved in all of it. And then when I graduated and I became a reporter, I realized that my interests were more along the lines of communication and media as a larger entity and not necessarily strictly in reporting. I had that realization maybe a year in and I started doing some more tangential design related things at the Wall Street Journal. Taught myself a ton of design things, I read a lot of books, I started teaching myself how to develop websites. But at some point I realized that I needed to take a little bit more time and do some more concentrated studies. So I decided to go back to school. I went to graduate school in Ireland and I earned my masters in creative digital media with a concentration in interaction design.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And so that&#8217;s what helped me fully pivot to design. And then while I was there, I did a lot of freelancing. Found out I really enjoyed UX and product design and thinking through a product&#8217;s life cycle. And so right after that, I joined Vox Media as a designer—which was kind of like the perfect combination of my background.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">You were brought in when you first joined Vox Media to be a part of their innovation team. Can you tell us why Vox created this team and what was the opportunity that they saw in the current media landscape?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong> </span>​<span class="s7">I joined the innovation team about two years ago when I first joined Vox Media. It was a very small team; there were four of us. And Vox has always been kind of at the forefront of a lot of new media trends. But up until that point, most stories were still being presented in a very text-based way. They still are now, but even more so a few years ago and that was just the norm at the time. And what Vox wanted to do was set up a team that would have the space to explore some different ways of telling stories and try to figure out what was working, what wasn&#8217;t, and where we could invest resources in the future. Even in the time I was on the team, and then time since, there have been so many additional avenues in order to tell stories. You could do it through chat, through voice. There&#8217;s just been so many other ways beyond an article format.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So that was our intent. We wanted to explore those spaces and figure out where we could grow potentially in the future.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">What was appealing to you personally about being in an innovator product role?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">When I was a reporter, I felt very confined to the templates that I had available to me. I could work within an article template. I could work through a feature template. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of space to reimagine what a story was at its core and that was something that our innovation team talked about. What could a story be? How could it be told? Could it be told in a couple of words? Does it need to be told in a way that could be read? Could it be showed more visually? There were a lot of questions that I found personally really intriguing and it hearkened back to what I wanted to do when I was a reporter. So that&#8217;s why I wanted to join the team. I wanted to be part of defining that. And being in a media company, there&#8217;s so much room for definition where there really aren&#8217;t that many precedents; where we are just making it up as we go, which is why I love being in media.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">This team was really well poised to actually act on some of those things and really set the tone of how we could operate in the future. And I know that&#8217;s a big mission—especially for four people in a large company—but that was my goal and that was something that I felt even if we could shift the company thinking a little bit or help influence the future product roadmap, that&#8217;s a really powerful thing. It was a really great position to be in for my first foray combining design and media. </span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span>​<span class="s7">I know that one of the first projects you worked on was an Amazon Echo Bot. Can you walk us through what that project was?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">So this was a project that we did a little bit toward the latter end of being on this team. And that project was a bot that we designed and developed in house in conjunction with the Northwestern University night lab. So they came to us with the initial idea for the project and they wanted to work with us to come up with just a testing bot that we could learn from and potentially launch. And so the bot was pretty simple. It ran through the Amazon Echo. It ran through a prompt-based nature. So you basically would ask the bot for the news. The bot would respond with the news and you could either dive into the story or you could move onto another story. We tested it a ton and launched it internally. It was really interesting. We learned a lot from the project.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">Around this time, were there a lot of other examples of media companies doing similar things or were you innovating right in a black hole and everything was completely new?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​ </strong><span class="s7">Honestly, there weren&#8217;t that many examples out there. There were a handful of projects, but they were very few and far between. At the time that we created the bot, the Amazon Echo API had only been opened the fall prior. So it was only available for a couple of months. But I think the biggest example was something called flash briefings—which is still available on the Amazon Echo now. It&#8217;s basically a funnel where news companies will say headlines and bits of stories and then the Echo will just play it. So it&#8217;s kind of just playing a story. They&#8217;re definitely better now, but at the time they weren&#8217;t really optimized for voice. It was like someone reading the beginning of an article to you.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And as far as other tools, not voice-related in this space, there were a few Slack bots here and there. And Google Home hadn&#8217;t been announced yet. Facebook Messenger hadn&#8217;t opened up their API yet for their chat interface. It was a really fresh arena and that was actually very tricky to find other competitors in the space because we just didn&#8217;t have a ton of examples to pull from. </span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">I feel like one or two years ago, there was a lot of hype around bots. A lot of articles that were basically like, &#8220;Bots are the way of the future.&#8221; And now that it&#8217;s more normal, those articles aren&#8217;t getting written as much anymore. At the time, did you sense that hype and how did you navigate that to focus on creating something that would be useful?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​ </strong><span class="s7">That&#8217;s an excellent question and I completely agree with that. And I would say that the bot hype isn&#8217;t totally over yet. It&#8217;s just becoming more normal. That was totally true and that&#8217;s something we definitely felt too. I mean in that fall, there were a slew of more bots that were even announced. New York Times had their election bot that came out. (We&#8217;re talking about the year of 2016.) There was a lot of hype. And there was definitely a lot of feelings like, &#8220;Oh, this is the wave.&#8221; And I think part of that was because there were all of these developer tools that were suddenly released to media companies. We could get our bots on Slack and we could get our bots on Facebook Messenger. And the idea of having all of these avenues to reach people that weren&#8217;t just our dot com websites was super appealing. To me, that was one of the biggest reasons there is a ton of hype around it.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And we definitely felt that too. I mean when we were thinking of innovation, we thought a lot about how can we explore this space. How can we explore the voice space? The chat space? But one thing I do want to note that it&#8217;s important to keep in mind, bots are not new. They&#8217;re not new at all. People have been interacting with bots for decades. Like if you think about like just calling a cable company and going through a voice automated system and having to say words to move along. That&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve been using for the past 40, 50 years. Even though bots felt new in the media space, they aren&#8217;t new as a concept. And so there are examples out there that we can pull from and that we should. And there&#8217;s a lot of space too to improve upon it. So that&#8217;s something I really wanted to do too with our voice bot.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">Did you work from any hypotheses around firstly how people consume news currently and how their news consumption behaviour might change? What kind of hypotheses and assumptions were you working from or trying to achieve?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong></span><span class="s7"> One of the biggest assumptions that we were making, just by nature of picking the project based on the Amazon Echo. We were making the assumption that people will actually listen, they&#8217;ll go to this product for news. I think we&#8217;re still trying to figure out if this is the right platform for news. So I think that was the biggest assumption we made. That like people will want to ask Alexa for news and that they would be open and willing to hearing the response.</span></p>

<p class="s8"><span class="s7">For example, on thing we tried to do to get around that is we decided to partner with The Verge for the content at the beginning. The Verge is a technology brand and we used their content because their audience tend to be a little bit quicker to adapt to new technologies and to try out new products. We figured that if there was one brand out there that would be amenable to this it would be The Verge.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So we tried to counter it, but that was definitely one big assumption that we were making at the start of the project.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong>Eleni: ​<span class="s7">How did you do user research when you&#8217;re dealing with users who are basically unfamiliar with the type of product that you&#8217;re designing? I know you used the example of voicemail systems where you can press numbers and work your way through the system. I don&#8217;t think people typically like that. So how did you approach the user research phase?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong> </span>​<span class="s7">So, you&#8217;re right. We looked at a lot of competitors out there. I read a lot of books. Google has put out some amazing resources on voice design and what makes good voice. Same as Amazon. There&#8217;s a lot of documentation on how to set up a voice bot in terms of narrative and structure. Actually a lot of our research happened from testing. So really amazing thing about working on a voice bot is it&#8217;s actually insanely easy to test. There&#8217;s so many ways you can test voice. We set up different experiments. We tried out different navigation structures. And then we test first in a pretty lo-fi way, and then eventually with the actual Echo prototype.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">Can you tell us about some of those tests?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​</strong> <span class="s7">So Northwestern University had the first idea for how to do tests and they recorded pieces of news. At the time, Amazon had a link where you could basically drop in text and then hit play and then it would be read back the way the Echo would read it. So Northwestern had the idea to play a bunch of things and then record it. Then a user asks them basically whatever they would say in response, then you would just play the correct response manually. So it was a way to test the navigation, test the flow, test the different prompts you could say or the different things that a user might say and react to that. And that was one of the lo-fi ways. Also I would read things out loud just in my own voice, which is negating some of the challenges of working with such a product like the Echo, but it helps get some of those similar things like flow and content down. And then finally, we did testing with an actual prototype. Our developer, he built a first version. We fed in the words. We set up the Echo. And then we recruited people mostly within our office and folks within our network because we were a pretty scrappy team and had to try to test however we could.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">At the time, there were a good number of people we tested who hadn&#8217;t interacted much with an Echo, so we grouped people into two groups. Ones who either had an Echo or had interacted with one before, and ones who were totally new. We had a couple different exercises to try to get people at a baseline level so we could be sure that we were actually testing our bot and not testing the Echo as a product.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​</strong> <strong><span class="s7">What were some of the discoveries that came from your tests? How did users react and what were some of the learnings that came out of all those different experiments?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​ </strong><span class="s7">One of the things we learned very quickly is people forget what they hear super fast. We originally had an introduction to explain what this bot was and how to use it. And what we found was people zoned out within about seven seconds of listening to it. So we shortened the introduction and we eventually just cut it, and launched right into the first story. And that seems very natural now, but a lot of the bots at the time that were being released had these lengthy introductions explaining what it was and how to use it. So just responding with the answer felt pretty novel to us at the time. And that was something that we found during testing.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">Another thing that was interesting that came about was due to our own team constraints and technical constraints. We decided to go with a keyword response type of navigation. So you would say a word and we would play a certain recording after that. We talked about doing more of an open format. But just at the time, this made the most sense for this product. But when we tested the different prompts, we found that people also really quickly forgot the prompt. So the bot, to give some context, is a gadget bot. So you would ask about a different gadget and then the bot would respond with different reviews about that gadget. And this is something The Verge already does a lot. They review different gadgets and different products.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So the three prompts were price, detail, and cool factor. In our testing, we found that people would immediately forget about all three of those prompts or they would commit a different set to memory—which I found super interesting. So what we did was we shorten the time basically between when people heard the prompts and when they&#8217;d have to act on it. So we set them at the end of the stories. We also prompted users again if there was silence about what the prompts were. And then finally, although we specified very few prompts, we made it incredibly open so you could say, &#8220;Give me the details,&#8221; or, &#8220;Tell me more,&#8221; or, &#8220;More facts.&#8221; We tried to anticipate a lot of other things someone might say in order to access more information and then we played that as well.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span>​<span class="s7">It&#8217;s interesting because it seems like in some ways the experience or the ultimate information that you get is not unlike if you listen to the radio for example for ten minutes in the morning and got your ten minute debrief. But then there&#8217;s this interactive element and this element of a bot. How does it change the consumption experience for the end user?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">Yeah, and I&#8217;m going to treat this question a little bit more like our vision for what this bot could be. We started with the idea that we wanted this bot to be a resource for someone who was looking to know more about a new gadget or a new product that&#8217;s out there. That&#8217;s a reason our audience comes to The Verge. They want to know more about products. They want to know The Verge&#8217;s take on it. So our original idea was that by taking that information and putting it in the format of a bot, it would make it much more searchable. Like our eventual goal was to have someone come up and say, &#8220;Hey, tell me about the new iPhone,&#8221; and then be able to get relevant information that&#8217;s told in The Verge&#8217;s editorial voice, that had their stamp of approval, and that you could come away with a better understanding of what that product is.</span></p>

<p class="s8"><hr /><p><em>"The compelling thing about voice is multitasking &amp; doing other things while getting info."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22The%20compelling%20thing%20about%20voice%20is%20multitasking%20%26%20doing%20other%20things%20while%20getting%20info.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3923' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So our version was the very, very basic level of what that could be. But our goal was really to get that content categorized in a way that would be searchable by voice and would be very relevant to an audience member who wanted to know more as they were going about doing their things. If they were preoccupied in other instances. So that was one route that we were thinking of. And honestly, we talked about a tone of other brands and other types of stories that we could tell through voice.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">To me, the compelling thing about voice is multitasking and doing other things while getting info. And so we tried to be very cognizant of that and not treat it like just a shorter version of an article, or an article read out loud. But we tried to think about what might a person be doing at any moment and why might they also simultaneously want information from our brand. What is that information? How can we deliver it in a way that&#8217;s suitable to voice? And I think that&#8217;s something that a lot of media companies are trying to get at and it doesn&#8217;t always come across that way because the first MVPs are never realizing the full vision. But I think that is something to be cognizant of because I do think there are a lot of products out there, products that we&#8217;ve made (even like the prototype we made), that really are just similar to sort of reading something out loud and that&#8217;s definitely not where we want to be.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong>Eleni: ​<span class="s7">I feel like obviously media has changed so much in the past couple of decades and there&#8217;s maybe a shallow way of thinking that says that peoples&#8217; attention spans can&#8217;t hold onto anything. And it&#8217;s interesting to hear how you&#8217;re designing for that and trying to accommodate that into the way the product is designed, and the way that people will be absorbing the information that it&#8217;s delivering.</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​</strong> <span class="s7">Yeah. I think it&#8217;s a really delicate balance, because we want to embrace that and help our information or stories fit into someone&#8217;s schedule, while at the same time maintaining quality and giving good information. And it&#8217;s really tough and it requires work on the product side, it requires work on the editorial side too to really make sure that we&#8217;re delivering the best parts. And so using the Echo bot as our example, we narrowed down those three categories of what is most important about this gadget. We had dozens of things that exist in our article that augment each gadget and we tried to distill it down to the most universal basic pieces—which I&#8217;m sure, depending on the product, is also really hard because in an article you can pick and choose. But in a lot of these bot paradigms, you have to commit to a structure. It&#8217;s interesting. We&#8217;re really rethinking how a story can get told.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">You wrote about this project and you said you didn&#8217;t want to just skin a voice and interface as a human conversation. How did you balance robot versus human elements when designing the way somebody would interact with your interface?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​</strong> <span class="s7">That was really tough. I wanted to make sure that our bot felt true to The Verge and felt true to Vox Media, but it&#8217;s challenging when you&#8217;re working with another product; when you have to weigh another product&#8217;s personality on top of your information. So I found that for instance when we were testing by reading the content out loud, it was perceived very differently than when we played it through the Alexa voice. And so one of the things that we decided to do was make a really purposeful decision to not try to bake additional personality into our bot. And the reason for that is because we felt that Alexa already has a lot of personality just innate in her voice and innate in the product, and we didn&#8217;t want to create a strange combo of The Verge voice and then the Echo voice. And so we made a decision to not try to be cutesy or have a name or do anything that would invoke a human type of feeling. What we wanted to do was to make sure that people knew that the content is being written by humans and the content has an editorial voice and the content comes from The Verge, and let The Verge name speak enough for its brand and personality.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So that was the decision that we made and I really think it would depend on the platform if we were to make that decision again. Like later that year, Google opened up their assistant API and they released the Google Home product and that has a very different personality from the Amazon Echo. So I think we would have handled that differently if we were in that instance. At the time it just felt like we wanted to get people to the content and we didn&#8217;t want to distract them with a less great human experience. </span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span>​<span class="s7">Were there any major assumptions or beliefs that you had before doing this project that got disproven as you got deeper into it?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">Yeah. Well, one of the things that I thought from the beginning was I assumed that people who had interacted with an Echo before or owned an Echo, would have a base level of behaviours that we could expect from them. So one of them being I thought people would know how to stop the bot and how to make it stop talking. So we didn&#8217;t initially build in anything beyond what the Amazon Echo offers by default with all of their bot products. We didn&#8217;t add anything in addition. And we found in testing that a lot of folks, even ones who had owned an Echo, didn&#8217;t know how to make it stop. And the command is really simple. It&#8217;s, &#8220;Alexa, stop.&#8221; But they didn&#8217;t all realize that that was what you needed to say and I think it&#8217;s because at the time it was still a super, super new product and a lot of people, even though they had one, had only had it for a few weeks or  months, or hadn&#8217;t interacted with it a ton.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="s8"><hr /><p><em>"It was so interesting to see how people prescribe different behaviours to a new technology."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22It%20was%20so%20interesting%20to%20see%20how%20people%20prescribe%20different%20behaviours%20to%20a%20new%20technology.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3923' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And so behaviours were really all over the place and I really contrast that to something like mobile behaviours. Like where at this point, the product is so saturated in its market that we have a level of behaviours that we know. We know that people use thumbs and we know how they scroll.  And we can&#8217;t assume that with a nascent technology. It was also even more pronounced in folks who had never interacted with an Echo before. There was one person who in testing she waited for the Echo to finish something and then at the end, she said, &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t want to hear that.&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say anything?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;I just felt like I&#8217;d be rude. Like it felt weird to like stop, Alexa.&#8221; It was so interesting to see how people prescribe different behaviours to a new technology. </span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">Yeah. This is something that I remember we ended up building in a lot of additional stop commands that our bot would recognize to just cease talking in order to counter that.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">I feel like another assumption that floats around is that people are generally passive about what they read in the news or passive about their news consumption. Do you think these technologies, like bot technology or chat technology, which by their very nature force you to interact with the platform, do they change how people interact with news or how they consume news? How does that interactivity change how people consume news?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting to hear you say that it&#8217;s more active because I think the hope of these technologies is that it will eventually be more in the background. It will be something that can fit into someone&#8217;s life. It could be something that they could ask, &#8220;How is figure skating scored?&#8221; from a trusted news source. Right now it would require someone getting to a screen and then finding that information versus with some of these technologies like you would be able to just ask that question. And I&#8217;m sure you could ask that question now and the Echo would answer that for you. But I think what we&#8217;re hoping is that the strength of our editorial voices and the strength of our content will be at the forefront of peoples&#8217; minds, and they&#8217;ll turn to these technologies and ask those questions of us. And I hope that it will be more baked into someone&#8217;s lifestyle and be less of an effort than it feels like right now.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s7">I think a lot of the examples that we&#8217;ve put out there so far do require a lot of effort to learn how to use it, to learn like how to engage with it. My vision for new storytelling forms is it’ll feel more seamless &amp; helpful to a person’s life.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Eleni:</strong></span><strong>​ <span class="s7">I know that you&#8217;re no longer on the innovation team. How does being a product designer on an innovation team differ from being a product designer on a more traditional product team? What are the differences in terms of how you&#8217;re thinking every day and what you&#8217;re doing every day?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​</strong> <span class="s7">Just for some context, I&#8217;m now on our audience team, which is the team that&#8217;s responsible for all the audience facing experiences, for the ways that people read, watch and engage with our content. And the team I&#8217;m on now is much more concerned with how can we enhance the way that people are interacting with our stories now in the places that they are, as opposed to trying to think about where we are going to be in the future in two years or five years from now. And so the design process is a lot different because now I have a lot more precedents to draw from, more data and what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not working. We can identify quicker wins. We&#8217;re not thinking as much of a total reworking of the landscape, but the same types of principles still hold true. </span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">So the same type of work I did, whether it was on a voice interface or a chat interface or now, it&#8217;s similar. So I&#8217;m still doing research. I&#8217;m still doing a lot of mocks. Still doing a lot of brainstorming. Still doing testing. So the actions are the same and that was actually something that was really helpful when I was getting onto the innovation team was just applying the same tried and true design practices to new interfaces I hadn&#8217;t worked with before. I mean good design is still good design and it goes through a process so fortunately that seems to me, at least so far, fairly consistent.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni: </span>​<span class="s7">There&#8217;s an idea that good products should be habit-forming. When you&#8217;re building a technology or designing for a technology that&#8217;s trying to introduce new habits and break old habits, how do you do that? What are the challenges associated with that and how do you design for that?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span></strong>​ <span class="s7">I think one of the challenges that we face is we&#8217;re still at the point where the way we mark engagement and success is we just want more attention and engagement interactions with all of our stories and platforms across the board. And unfortunately, people just have limited time and so we haven&#8217;t come up with a really solid way yet of thinking about how engagement in one platform negatively impacts the other.</span></p>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And we do that in some respects in smaller silos of we want to see more page views, we don&#8217;t want to sacrifice time spent on that page or scroll depth. But I think really the metric that we need to be aiming for, and that we&#8217;re starting to, is usefulness. Are people getting the value that they need out of our stories, regardless of where they&#8217;re finding them? And for some people, that might be only on our website. Some people might only be on our newsletters. It might be through a new platform like voice. And for most, it&#8217;s probably going to be some sort of combination. So I think it&#8217;s challenging because we don&#8217;t want to necessarily move people from one habit to another habit, or one platform to another platform. I think we need to be better about thinking holistically, like how does this all fit into somebody&#8217;s life and how can we make those interaction points as seamless as possible.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="s8"><hr /><p><em>"My vision for new storytelling forms is it’ll feel more seamless &amp; helpful to a person’s life."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22My%20vision%20for%20new%20storytelling%20forms%20is%20it%E2%80%99ll%20feel%20more%20seamless%20%26%20helpful%20to%20a%20person%E2%80%99s%20life.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3923' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="s8">​<span class="s7">And then practically speaking, one of the ways that we try to do that is by linking content among each other within our platform. So on our voice bot, we said, &#8220;Visit theverge.com/circuitbreaker if you want more information.&#8221; We tried to link back to our website. On our website right now on Vox, we just launched a new podcast. We have a prominent display of that podcast and you can listen to it on the home page, as you&#8217;re doing other things. So we try to cross reference, to just build awareness. But I mean ideally we want people to feel like their avenues that they&#8217;re getting information is useful and it works for them. So those are the habits that we want to focus on building.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">How did this project wrap up? Where is it now?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​</strong> <span class="s7">So we launched an in-house prototype that was really fun to play with and taught us a ton of what we can do in the future. It didn&#8217;t launch publicly, but we have a lot of the ideas tucked away in our back burner, a lot of documentation of what we want to do in the future. And in the meantime, I did write a blog post with a lot of our takeaways and our findings. And I&#8217;m curious to see too what other news companies come up with.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">How did your time in this role make you a better product designer?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong> </span>​<span class="s7">I think it&#8217;s made me become a lot more cognizant of what behaviours I&#8217;m assuming of people and also the role of visuals. A lot of our projects were chat-based and voice-based, they were around word—which feels very natural to me because my background is in writing and reporting. But I realized the reliance that we have on visual indicators to tell people where they are and what they can do next and orient them and so I&#8217;m really cognizant about using that intentionally and not like overtly. So I think that&#8217;s helped me become a much more careful designer.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">Did it change how you see design itself?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><span class="s6"><strong>Sanette:</strong> </span>​<span class="s7">It made me feel like design really does have the potential to change, like make a lot of significant change in peoples&#8217; lives. I know that sounds like a huge statement, but I do think it&#8217;s very exciting to work on new interfaces. I find that very fulfilling and it&#8217;s something I want to do again in the future. And I think it&#8217;s because it breaks down a lot of paradigms about how you think design works. I felt like we were setting a new standard and new way of how it could work or at least thinking about it. It just made me excited to be in this field and able to be working on projects like this.</span></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Eleni:</span>​ <span class="s7">Yeah. I mean we talked already a little bit about how much news has changed and I think journalism is arguably more impacted by product people than journalists in terms of how it&#8217;s going to evolve. What role do you think product design is going to play in continuing to change how humans are consuming information and stories?</span></strong></p>
<p class="s8"><strong><span class="s6">Sanette:</span>​ </strong><span class="s7">As product design becomes more evolved as a field within media companies and as we start to do more research on our audience members and understand them better, I think we&#8217;ll be able to create better products that will better serve them in their lives and better connect them with the information that they&#8217;re interested in that our reporters are putting together. I think for a long time, product has been more of a, I don&#8217;t want to say, blocker, but it&#8217;s been something that reporters have had to work around in order to tell stories or try to use what they had available to them to do the best that they could. I think on the product team at Vox, we are much better poised to help streamline the work that&#8217;s time consuming or not as helpful for them and help provide new routes where they can better express their storytelling.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Surprise! It’s a bonus episode of <strong><a href="https://hubs.ly/H0bxp540" target="_blank">Product to Product</a>&#8216;s second season</strong>, a podcast for / by product people!</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to the episode below:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/product-to-product/id1293415837?mt=2" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-4037 alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-apple.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a><a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Is7ibqzwhkqszuin6l2li7f3in4" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4036 size-full alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-google.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">As we continue to explore <strong>the human side of product</strong> this season, we&#8217;ve paired up with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikebelsito" target="_blank">Mike Belsito</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michaelsacca" target="_blank">Michael Sacca</a></strong> (same first name!), the hosts of <strong><a href="http://rocketship.fm/" target="_blank">Rocketship.FM</a></strong>, for this episode.</p>
<p>Rocketship is a podcast that dives into everything from product to growth, design to management and everything in between. This past season on Rocketship, the entire season was devoted to product and growth. And one of the topics Mike and Michael did a deep-dive into were the tools product people apply to understand their users better—specifically <strong>u</strong><strong>ser personas</strong> and <strong>jobs to be done</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Since Mike and Michael did so much research on the topics, and interviewed a bunch of people using these frameworks, they shared their insights into what they learned from the episodes. Our colleague, Eleni, picked their brains on what differentiates these two frameworks, how to apply these concepts, and why jobs to be done has become the popular tool on the block.</span></p>
<p>The episode can be listened to above, and we’ve also included a transcript below. You can subscribe to Product to Product on <strong>iTunes</strong> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/product-to-product/id1293415837?mt=2https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/product-to-product/id1293415837?mt=2" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>) and <strong>Google Play</strong> (<a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Is7ibqzwhkqszuin6l2li7f3in4" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>), or <strong>get the latest episodes delivered to your inbox</strong> by subscribing <strong><a href="https://hubs.ly/H0bDX3q0" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Mike and Michael, thanks so much for being here, I&#8217;m really looking forward to chatting. How&#8217;s it going?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> It&#8217;s going great on my end for sure. This is Mike.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> Fantastic, this is Michael Sacca.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I was saying before we started this chat that I have personally never interviewed two people with the same name at the same time so we will see how this goes!</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I was pushing for Sacca and Belsito but..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Right? For anyone here who is not familiar with you guys, can you both just take a second, introduce yourselves and tell us what you do?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Sure, my name is Mike Belsito and I&#8217;m the co-founder of Product Collective, which is really a community for product people. We have 15,000 product people from all over, mostly on the software side. But we have a newsletter, we do webinars often. We have a very active Slack channel, several thousand product people in that. We have a conference that we put on twice a year called Industry the Product Conference. It takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the fall and in Europe—Dublin, Ireland—in the Spring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With Michael, I also co-host Rocketship, which I joined a couple years ago, but it&#8217;s been something that Michael&#8217;s run for several years now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> Yeah, I co-host Rocketship with Mike and we&#8217;ve been doing Rocketship going on four years now and almost over 300 episodes. I also am the Director of Business Development and Marketing at Dribbble, which is one of the largest design communities online. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I know the most recent season on Rocketship, you&#8217;re focusing all about product and growth. Why was now the moment to make that your focus?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> It just felt nice to focus in on a topic that&#8217;s really essential for any entrepreneur. It&#8217;s a growing topic in our industry where we have this position of product management, which sits right under the CEO often, and yet there&#8217;s no formal education for it and a lot of people have questions about it. Mike has been razor focused in this area for the last couple of years. It just felt like we had some expertise in this department, why not buckle down on it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Yeah, I feel like product, regardless of what department you&#8217;re in, there&#8217;s value in learning more about product. Even if you&#8217;re a marketer, if you&#8217;re a sales person, the more that you understand that function, the better you&#8217;re probably going to be at your job.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah, and a lot of the listeners of Rocketship in the past have been entrepreneurs. When I first met Michael, I was an entrepreneur. I&#8217;ve kind of been the entrepreneur from the founder&#8217;s side and the early stage executive side too. The realization for me after the fact, entrepreneurs, whether they think of themselves as this or not, they&#8217;re product people. I actually think the evolution from being entrepreneur-focused to product-focused, it&#8217;s actually a pretty natural one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: For sure. I feel like so many entrepreneurs are like, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize I was a product person,&#8221; until recently when they&#8217;ve been doing that work for a decade. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> It&#8217;s definitely the camp I was in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So the focus we want to have for this interview is talking to you guys about a few of your recent episodes, which were centered around user personas and the jobs to be done framework. These are two different tools product people might use to understand their users better. I&#8217;m wondering if you can start by telling us what is a user persona. Why do product people use these?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Sure, for me, a user persona is really defining as deep as you can with a picture, name and everything, who you&#8217;re actually serving. Sometimes we as product people and entrepreneurs, we might have a product and we might think it applies to so many groups. But really at the end of the day there&#8217;s probably a couple of very specific use cases that your product is extremely relevant for and is really even designed for.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So user personas, you&#8217;re not only saying, &#8220;Hey this is designed for a product market.&#8221; Or &#8220;No, it&#8217;s designed for this product marketer who actually has 40 years of experience working at a software company and is working at a mid-sized company, but is often really confused about how to approach marketing.&#8221; You can go on and on. You give this person a name, maybe you even give this person a face. You might tear out a magazine or find it online, but this user persona becomes a real person that you&#8217;re actually developing a product for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We did go in to a whole episode that was related to personas, which was fun and we&#8217;ll get into here, but when I think of personas, that&#8217;s what comes to mind. Michael, what am I missing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> I think it&#8217;s putting a generic face to the person that you&#8217;re building for and that&#8217;s why user personas have a wide variety of usage—which obviously we&#8217;ll get into. But the important part of personas is how do we humanize the people that are using our product when we can&#8217;t see them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Can you take us into your episode? Michael, why don&#8217;t you tell us about what you guys covered in your particular episode on user personas. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> We wanted to go deeper into what a user persona is. Mike actually went out and we identified three different user personas that we wanted to try to highlight. We found these descriptions that real companies use of how they wrote their user persona. Mike went and tried to find this person in real life and interview them. See what actually motivated them; see what they were actually like in person and how accurate this description was. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The whole episode is basically contrasting the generic description of who they&#8217;re building for with the real person who is a gym owner, and what are their anxieties, what are their worries and what do they look for in a product like the one that was being sold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How did these people feel when you confronted them with their persona? I can imagine someone being resistant to the concept that they could be bottled down to this profile.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Actually, I think both of the folks that we talked to, they had fun with it, to realize, &#8220;Hey now I know what a persona is. Wait, somebody&#8217;s actually using me as a persona?&#8221; Here&#8217;s the thing, both of them had critical feedback for whoever it was that created that persona to begin with. I think that&#8217;s a cool thing. If we could think of creating these personas, then you literally ask the persona for feedback on how you could make it better. We should all be so lucky if our personas could literally tell us how to better define them and how to think a little more about making the perfect persona. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both of the people we talked to had a lot of fun with it. It made them think about how might I use even this exact approach in going about their own day-to-day business. </span>I will say a couple of things that came to mind for me in both cases. One thing that stands out that I think is worth mentioning here is the personal side of things. Both of those personas that we used, one was for a gym owner, the other was for a VP of marketing at a high-growth software company. When we talked to both of them, they felt like their personal lives actually should be part of the persona because that has a big impact on some of the decisions that they&#8217;re making.</p>

<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"User persona: I use it with my team to humanize the product that we are building for people."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22User%20persona%3A%20I%20use%20it%20with%20my%20team%20to%20humanize%20the%20product%20that%20we%20are%20building%20for%20people.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3908' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Professional decisions people make, it&#8217;s not necessarily a hole in a vacuum. For instance, that gym owner, she said, &#8220;Hey look, I do have a family. If somebody is trying to market to me, or if somebody is trying to create a product that&#8217;s for me, I might have different needs than somebody that is a gym owner and this is the only thing involved in their life.&#8221; Maybe building in some of those personal characteristics into the persona might be more important than people might think.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Good marketing connects with people on a personal and human level so I think, like you said Michael, just humanizing someone via a persona gives that much more color when you&#8217;re working on your marketing or your product. What are some of the other benefits of creating user personas for product people?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> We hear about people like Bezos who put a chair in the room right when they&#8217;re making product decisions and I think personas can also serve as that reminder of who we&#8217;re building for. I have design teams ask, &#8220;Who is the customer here? Who am I designing for?&#8221; I think it helps as that reminder of is this appropriate for Jill, or Mark, or whoever your persona is. You can think through those product decisions that you&#8217;re making and try to put yourself in their shoes. And that was one of the points that we really wanted to illustrate with the episode was the deeper you go with these, the more useful they are because their life isn&#8217;t just staring at a screen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think a lot of times we write very surfaced-level user personas, but the more that we actually understand about someone&#8217;s life, the better product we can build—if user personas is one of the tools that we&#8217;re using on our product team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I like the idea of going back and asking for feedback. I feel like the persona usually comes out of interviews but then when the interviews over, it&#8217;s over. Whereas the idea of going back is iteratively improving it and making it deeper and deeper. I feel like there is a vibe in the air that personas have limitations and that they might be too cookie cutter. Why do you think this kind of dispute comes up? What are personas missing when someone&#8217;s saying that? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I think it&#8217;s not the end all be all, right? We shouldn&#8217;t think of user personas as some sort of magical tool where if we&#8217;re using them everything&#8217;s going to be great and it&#8217;s going to give us all the answers. It&#8217;s a tool that we can use and we should treat it like that; just like we have so many other tools that are disposable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I can understand folks that give feedback like well okay you have a couple of personas but you have all sorts of other customers that are outside of that persona. Or most of your customers don&#8217;t fit that persona exactly correct, so what good is that? But again, I do think even though that might be the case, the fact that we are now humanizing the customer and now we can think about who we&#8217;re building product for as a real person. That alone might have implications, as we&#8217;re building product that we might not have thought about if we weren&#8217;t approaching it via something like a persona. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think if we&#8217;re thinking about it as the end all be all and some sort of magical pill that we can take that makes everything better, we&#8217;re probably setting ourselves up for failure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: With that in mind, how important is accuracy when it comes to the personas? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> Yeah it is, I think accuracy is incredibly important and also incredibly hard to achieve here—which is one of the downfalls of a persona. They will bring biases into it. If you do use personas heavily in your product decisions, that is going to bring biases of who creates that persona and who is that persona. That is a risk you open yourself up to because it&#8217;s not something that we intend to do. But I think that you&#8217;re leaving yourself vulnerable if you don&#8217;t use another technique along with the personas and you don&#8217;t use personas as simply a humanization exercise for your team. If you&#8217;re making big product decisions based on personas, you&#8217;re probably going to miss a lot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Let&#8217;s jump to jobs to be done because you also did three recent episodes covering the jobs to be done framework. For anyone who has never heard the word jobs to be done before, tell us what this is and why it&#8217;s so popular. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> More than just talk about jobs to be done on the episodes, we opened it up for Product Collective and our conference Industry. We actually put it all out there and were pretty transparent and we worked with Bob Moesta, who&#8217;s one of the co-architects of the jobs to be done framework and he literally conducted jobs to be done interviews for us to show us the way.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"It’s an interrogation technique, as if you’re doing a criminal investigation."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22It%E2%80%99s%20an%20interrogation%20technique%2C%20as%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20doing%20a%20criminal%20investigation.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3908' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Rewind all the way back to just jobs to be done, it&#8217;s a different approach or mindset about thinking about what a product is. Sometimes we think of a product as something that we buy, or has these features and it does this thing for us. But really the jobs to be done concept is, trying to think of a product as not just that, but it&#8217;s actually something that we&#8217;re hiring to do a specific job. Sometimes it&#8217;s not the job that one might naturally think the product was hired to do. You might say, &#8220;Whoa, gosh, an analytics platform. Oh okay, so the job we&#8217;re hiring you to do is analytics.&#8221; Maybe the job is actually job safety for you as a product person so you have data to point to. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It could be many things, but trying to figure out what those jobs are, in order to do that, you need to interview customers. So that&#8217;s where the jobs to be done interview comes in and that&#8217;s where we brought Bob in, and he basically did these interviews side by side with us for Product Collective and Industry. </span>We were very selfish in that we figured, hey if we&#8217;re going to pick a company, let&#8217;s pick our own and let&#8217;s see if Bob can help us with these—which was just awesome.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So walk us through that. What did you guys do together and what did he bring to the process that you didn&#8217;t have before?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> It all started at our conference. It was our third annual Industry conference and Bob was one of our speakers. I remember backstage having a conversation with him and saying, &#8220;Yeah we do attend the interviews because we try to treat Industry like a product.&#8221; I never called them jobs to be done interviews because I don&#8217;t necessarily know what I&#8217;m doing when it comes to jobs to be done and he said, &#8220;What? I&#8217;ll do them with you; it&#8217;s not rocket science. If you&#8217;re up for it sometime.&#8221; I would make sure that I was never going to forget that he said that because I wanted to take him up on that later on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Really what Bob did was he said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you go out and find an attendee that came to Industry for the first time in 2017. Why don&#8217;t you find an attendee that has been to Industry multiple times, and let&#8217;s have a call with them. Ask them for an hour of their time and I want to be on that call and you can be on it with me, so you can hear the types of questions I&#8217;m asking. You can hear how deep I go.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The big takeaway for me from those conversations was just that Bob went so deep with those attendees. The attendee interviews we used to do, I&#8217;d schedule them for 20 minutes because I know this is precious time and I don&#8217;t want to waste an attendee&#8217;s time. The questions as a result, got surface-level answers. But Bob went so deep and we went into that in the episode. If you listen to the episode you can see the types of questions Bob&#8217;s asking, but also not letting the attendee off the hook. If the attendee&#8217;s not really giving an answer, Bob drills into the attendee, &#8220;Okay, but really, but why did you do this, or how did you do this?&#8221; </span>For me, that was probably the most illuminating part of the episodes that we did with Bob.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How did he get so deep? Was it just asking the follow-ups or did he ask specific types of questions that were different from what you&#8217;ve been asking before?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> He was asking more specific questions. If you&#8217;re familiar with the concept of the five why&#8217;s—not to say that Bob was implementing five why&#8217;s or asking somebody why five times to get somewhere. But if somebody was saying, &#8220;Yeah, I attended Industry because I got an email for it and I thought it sounded cool.&#8221; Maybe in the past I would have been like, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s great.&#8221; Then when you signed up, Bob would say, &#8220;Well wait a minute, when did you get that email? And where were you? Were you at home? Were you in bed scrolling through emails? Were you at work and it came across your computer screen? Then you got that email, did you go right to the website that day? How much time did you spend on the website? What song was on your Spotify?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> He went very deep and got very specific and I think in talking with Bob afterwards and asking, &#8220;Hey, why is that so important to go that deep?&#8221; Bob sets it up like what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re sort of making a movie here, making a documentary, and we&#8217;re trying to get as much background from this person as possible so we can paint the scene. I think it&#8217;s really a combination of asking very specific questions. It&#8217;s so specific, you&#8217;re trying to get into the person&#8217;s mindset when they actually made the decision to purchase your product. Yeah, Michael, I&#8217;m probably missing things here. What would you add to that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> It&#8217;s an interrogation technique to get all the information possible, as if you&#8217;re doing a criminal investigation. He says that&#8217;s how he builds his story because a decision is never a binary decision, and even comparing different products isn&#8217;t good enough to know what you should be doing with your product. He&#8217;s looking at what was the atmosphere like around that decision. What were the key anxieties that pushed or pulled you to or from that decision?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Those are the things that he&#8217;s trying to figure out so that either you can make product changes to adapt to it, build new products to satisfy them, or change your marketing and how you&#8217;re describing things. The beauty of jobs to be done is you move away from what the person looks like, and into what the product satisfies—which there are no blind spots in that and there are no biases. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Right. It&#8217;s almost like moving from who they are as a profile to what is in their psyche in the moment when their making the buying decision. You&#8217;re talking about this anxiety that people feel about wasting someone&#8217;s time during these interviews, or even just being too pushy. How can PM&#8217;s work that muscle to get over their anxieties about crossing some kind of line and push themselves to actually diver deeper to find the value of jobs to be done?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> My take on it is, it&#8217;s a comfortability thing and sometimes it just takes doing it over and over and over again. Look, this person, they&#8217;ve already said they want to help, they&#8217;ve already said, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m willing to spend time with you to help you dig in and make your product better.&#8221; Just the fact that they agreed to have the conversation with you, they&#8217;re opening themselves up and so maybe we just need, as product people, not be afraid to dig in deep with them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> For me, before I was setting the expectation, be it a 20 minute conversation, I wouldn&#8217;t want to try to take an hour of their time. I think for me now I&#8217;m trying to schedule those conversations to be longer and as long as they&#8217;re agreeing to it, I&#8217;m going to dig in deep with them. After one conversation, or actually a couple conversations, tagging along with Bob, I&#8217;m not perfect at it yet; I wouldn&#8217;t even say I&#8217;m good at it yet. The only way that I will get better at it is to just keep doing it over and over and over again. I think that&#8217;s the best way to get over that fear. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So Mike, what did you learn from those interviews? What were the jobs that you thought Industry was being hired for, and how did that shift after you went though this process?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I will say, beforehand, the jobs that we thought, they were very surface-level. We&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, people come to Industry to learn from the best product people, to meet other product people and to find inspiration, to do better work.&#8221; You could say those three things for any conference in any industry, period, right? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When we really started to dig in, we were learning from some people just things that we had never even known before. Bob had an in-person conversation at Industry and came to find out for this specific attendee, the only reason they came, is they were identifying analytics products to use for their company and they saw that three analytics companies were going to be exhibiting at Industry, and they thought, &#8220;You know what, we could compare all three and get demos all on the same day.&#8221; The whole conference was just a bonus to them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What does that mean for us? I will say one thing that we&#8217;re doing this year, and our sponsors love it, is before Industry actually takes place, we&#8217;re surveying all attendees to say, &#8220;Hey, what are the platforms you&#8217;re most interested in in getting demos with? We can help set you up one-on-one meetings at your preferred time.&#8221; So for the attendee that is in the same boat as the other attendee, where they just have multiple platforms they&#8217;re trying to evaluate, they can get their preferred time to meet. They don&#8217;t have to worry about, &#8220;Gosh there&#8217;s 10 other people trying to talk to this company.&#8221; For the sponsor, now they have a guaranteed meeting with somebody at Industry. They love that and so it&#8217;s a value-add we&#8217;re offering to them but it&#8217;s also one way of making the attendee experience better.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Bob goes into his questions, trying to identify what are their anxieties for products that they&#8217;re trying to hire. One of the anxieties that we&#8217;ve discovered for Industry is that, when people go, they feel a responsibility—because often times, it&#8217;s a company that&#8217;s paying for their ticket to come and the flights and the hotels—about having to prove that it was all worth it when they get back to the office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Being able to take notes, that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s on their mind. Well, one of the things that we&#8217;re going to be doing for Industry this year, and it&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve advertised as a feature (it&#8217;s probably going to be something we delight people with), is we&#8217;re actually hiring somebody at the conference to take notes so before the person gets back to their office, they will have a nice pdf with all the notes from the various talks that happened at Industry. They wanted to take their own notes, that&#8217;s great, but they don&#8217;t have to feel that pressure and that anxiety of having to do it because we&#8217;re going to help them, do it for them basically. We wouldn&#8217;t have done that if it wasn&#8217;t for these two interviews that we did with Bob.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I feel like the things people are anxious about don&#8217;t really come out in a more surface-level ten minute survey.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> That&#8217;s right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Okay. Let&#8217;s step back again and look at user personas and jobs to be done in tandem. Michael, maybe you can sum up for us, what are the benefits of user persona versus the benefit of jobs to be done?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> User persona: I use it with my team to humanize the product that we are building for people. But beyond that I don&#8217;t make many decisions based on the user persona. For that, we turn to jobs to be done and really try to figure out what are those anxieties; what job are we actually doing for people and how can we do that better? I do use both even in every day work but I think that personas are a limited tool, and jobs really helps me to make the harder decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Okay, Mike? Anything to add?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> Yeah. I think we can look at these things as tools and depending on the stage of where we&#8217;re at, focusing on one versus the other can make a lot of sense. It&#8217;s hard to have those jobs to be done interviews without really understanding who it is we&#8217;re actually serving and one way to understand that is through those personas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Eleni: I&#8217;ve seen a couple blogs about this, that says, &#8220;User personas should be replaced by jobs to be done.&#8221; What do you say to that perspective?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> To me it just feels like apples to computers. </span><span class="s1">They&#8217;re two totally different things and they should both be tools that are available to us that we&#8217;re using to make our products better. I don&#8217;t think they necessarily compete with each other. I actually think if you&#8217;re using both frameworks, they compliment each other quite well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> I think too many times we&#8217;re pitting solutions against each other. There can only be one methodology alive at any given time, and it&#8217;s just not a healthy way to go about it. I think both serve very good purposes. I think they both live next to each other, and as a product manager, as just a product person, it&#8217;s just tools that you pull out when you need it. I think these articles are more for sensationalism than actual functionality and should really be treated as such.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Do you think the same in interview techniques can result in a user persona and a jobs to be done framework? Could you create both from one interview?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. I think you could start to get the picture but I think the jobs to be done is really a much deeper interview and it&#8217;s really focused on how does that person find your product, and what job does your product do for that person. I think the persona can be a lot wider than that. It could be things that aren&#8217;t necessarily related to your product, but could be an interest of theirs throughout the day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The gym owner, it mentions she&#8217;s a mom. It mentions that they have these other hobbies and interests that are outside of her purchasing that software. You could cover both, but I do think there&#8217;s a different goal at the end of it for each one. But personas are a much less interrogative approach, so you&#8217;re going to look at those differently.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Eleni: In what way do each of these frameworks give you a window into having empathy with your users?</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I think that&#8217;s one of the benefits of both of them. With personas, we are trying to understand as much as we can about our user, our customer, who it is we&#8217;re trying to serve. With jobs to be done it takes that to a little bit of a deeper level in terms of what the relationship is with our product. I just think in both cases we&#8217;re learning a lot about our customers, we&#8217;re learning a lot about who we&#8217;re serving, and the more that we can learn about them, the better we can empathize with them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Sometimes as product people, it&#8217;s so easy to get caught up in analytics that are in front of us, or you just get mired down in meetings—especially in developing user personas. And then with jobs to be done, we&#8217;re in front of customers and anytime you could put yourself in front of customers just naturally, you&#8217;re going to have more empathy for them. That&#8217;s one of the things that I like about both of those frameworks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Speaking on that point of analytics, the jobs to be done interview for example, is a very qualitative process, where you&#8217;re really &#8220;digging in deep&#8221; with another human being. How can product people then connect that to whatever metrics they&#8217;re trying to push towards?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> We do this every day. I think that jobs to be done helps you understand obviously the person and some of the anxieties but without the data. It&#8217;s really hard to find the right solution. The data can also help to inform where you are weak in a product. It&#8217;s hard to talk about generalities, but if you have holes or places where people are dropping off, that is where you can focus that job to be done interview, to figure out where you&#8217;re failing.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"Jobs to be done might not feel right for you and you still might be a fantastic product manager."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Jobs%20to%20be%20done%20might%20not%20feel%20right%20for%20you%20and%20you%20still%20might%20be%20a%20fantastic%20product%20manager.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3908' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Bob has a great story about selling condos in Detroit that we cover earlier in the season and he had people who are interested in these condos but there was something where they were just dropping off. They would lose interest, they weren&#8217;t actually purchasing. When he went back and did the jobs to be done interview, he found out why. The reason was, these people were downsizing and they didn&#8217;t have room for their kitchen table which had all of this emotional baggage around it. It&#8217;s where their kids sat at Christmas, it&#8217;s where they opened up presents, it&#8217;s where they celebrated every birthday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> None of those were on the radar of the people trying to sell the condo. But once they set up a place, they rearranged the condos so that the table could fit in or they gave them storage so they didn&#8217;t have to get rid of the table. That&#8217;s when they were able to move these condo units, but it takes both sides right. You have to know where to focus and that&#8217;s where the data often can tell you and that&#8217;s where the jobs to be done can start to give you that answer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I definitely want to send our listeners to go listen to your episodes because they really go a lot more in depth about this whole interview process. Before we do that, do you guys have anything else to add on either user personas or the jobs to be done framework and how those can be applied?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I don&#8217;t have anything more to add I think we got into it pretty well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> Yeah, I think they&#8217;re great tools. I wouldn&#8217;t hate one or the other and I think any product person, you&#8217;ve got to love your tools. Just learn it and figure out what works for you because there&#8217;s no right answer. Jobs to be done might not feel right for you and you still might be a fantastic product manager. I think it&#8217;s really about finding your style and figuring out how these tools work into your decision making process because that&#8217;s really what they and the actual tool do. We get really into the semantics of both of these, but none of that really matters; it&#8217;s really how it works for you in your personal work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Where can people find you?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> Go to <a href="http://rocketship.fm/" target="_blank">rocketship.fm</a> and you can find all the episodes. They&#8217;re broken out into the episodes and the full interviews or you could search rocketship.fm anywhere you listen to podcasts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Mike, what about you? Or what about both of you personally, where can people find each of you? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> I&#8217;m on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/belsito" target="_blank">@belsito</a>. Also, if people are product people, they&#8217;re definitely welcome to join us a Product Collective, which is just at productcollective.com. Or join us in person at Industry, which is the conference we organize each Fall in Cleveland and each Spring in Europe. That&#8217;s at <a href="http://industryconference.com/" target="_blank">INDUSTRYconference.com</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Great, thank you both so much. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Mike:</strong> You too, take care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Michael:</strong> See you all later.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Thank you, Melissa, for joining us on our Product to Product podcast.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> Of course! Thanks for having me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I wanted to start by asking you about Product Institute. Can you talk a little bit about what it is, and why you started this education initiative?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> So, Product Institute is an online school for product managers to level up their skills. Right now, we have launched our first course, last year, which is a 10-week program in the fundamentals of product management. We call it our foundations class. It really goes over everything a product manager should know, from how to identify and set good goals, to discovering problems, talking to your users. That&#8217;s our first stab at the first course. We&#8217;re going to be launching more courses this year, a little bit smaller, and we&#8217;re going to do some fun stuff with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I think the overall goal that I really see for this school is to make it that, a school, where people can come and learn. It&#8217;s not just a course. It&#8217;s not just one and done in 10 weeks. We really want to build it into something where you can come, learn new skills, new techniques and things about product management that you don&#8217;t find in many other places. And feel like, even if you&#8217;re an experienced product manager or somebody who&#8217;s just starting out, there is just a wealth of information there for you to learn from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: One of the things I really love is the positioning of this course, which is, how to think like a product manager. From your perspective, what does it mean to think like a product manager? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa</strong>: This is something that I noticed as I was training product managers over the year. I&#8217;ve trained a couple thousand people at different companies, and I think what sets a decent product manager apart from a really great product manager, is really the way they think and approach problems. To me, thinking like a product manager is about problem solving. It&#8217;s about synthesizing a lot of information, understanding the system, trying to piece together what is the problem, breaking it down into small manageable chunks so you can analyze it, and then figuring out what is the right solution from there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s what we try to teach throughout this course. We teach practical tools throughout the whole thing, but what I want people to do is really walk away being better decision makers; being able to take the information we give them and apply it in real life, to think through why are they doing things. To me, that&#8217;s the most important part. I think with some of the other courses that I&#8217;ve seen or have been a part of, they teach people the tools. But in practice, what happens is—as a coach, I go to these companies and I coach people—they grab the tools and they&#8217;ll start putting them into practice, but some people will peak at that point. They know how to use a tool, but they don&#8217;t know how to use it within the system. To me, making that transition is really important for a product manager. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Thinking like a product manager involves making the right decisions about what tools, what processes we use, where we are in the life cycle of the product, and really understanding the problem, breaking down a large system and figuring out how it all relates to each other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: That&#8217;s definitely a challenge that I&#8217;ve experienced with some of the PM&#8217;s I&#8217;ve worked with as well.  What does it mean to not think like a product manager, and how do you undo previous bad habits in terms of thinking? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> I see a lot of people treat it like a linear process. That&#8217;s something where I&#8217;m trying to really break down in the product managers I teach. They were taught that you identify the problem, figure out what the solution is for the problem, spec it out, figure out what&#8217;s going on, hand it off to the developers, develop it, put it out, get feedback, and go back to the beginning. That&#8217;s really just one piece of it. There are lot of tools that come out in the market today that promote that type of linear thinking. I think people see that it&#8217;s just do step one, step two, step three, for every single use case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What I want product managers to understand is it&#8217;s not a linear process. You may never start in the same place, depending on where you are. One of the things that I try to get all my product managers to do when I coach them is for them to stop and think about what they know and what they don&#8217;t know. We always go back to these, known knowns and known unknowns.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> What I try to ask them is: Where are you? Do you know what your goal is? No? Okay, we have to go figure out what your goal is before we can do anything else. Do you know what problem you&#8217;re solving? No? Okay, we have to go figure that out. Yes! Okay, you might know it. Maybe let&#8217;s just confirm and skip it. We don&#8217;t have to spend four weeks, five weeks, six weeks in problem exploration mode if you know what the problem is. Yet, I see some new product managers get stuck there. They think they have to spend a lot of time in that phase. They think they have to go through it. But to me, if you&#8217;re 100% certain about what the problem is, it&#8217;s readily apparent. You just confirm and move on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The same thing goes for solution exploration or really iterating on a concept. Having a first version of a product out there and sitting on it. So what I see is people fall back to that linear approach, where they must go through problem exploration. You do want to acknowledge each one of those pieces, but if you&#8217;re 100% sure about those areas, you need to move on. Know that you may discover that one of your assumptions about the solution that you thought was right, was wrong, and then might have to go back to the beginning. It&#8217;s not a root path. Doing product management is not just one simple process that you follow. It&#8217;s about analyzing where you are, and depending on where you are, choosing the right path and the right tools to go forward. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: I really like the concept of making sure it&#8217;s not just a linear path and really mapping out your goals to see your known knowns and your known unknowns. How do you tie that concept, to the idea that I was reading on your blog, called the Build Trap?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> The Build Trap is really where we get stuck in this mode, as a company, releasing feature after feature without really stopping to think about: Is this the right feature? Is it hitting our goals? Are we aligned to the company vision? Are we actually going after the right thing? Instead, we really focus on the output of how many number of features we released. We think value is tied in the quantity, rather than the quality and problems we solve for our customers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I see so many companies really suffer from it. They look at productivity as the amount of things you release to customers, rather than the amount of value you provide. I think quantity and value get really mis-concepted and they get tied together, when sometimes, that&#8217;s not really the case. When companies are stuck in the Build Trap, they don&#8217;t really have a firm or set product management domain in their company. They&#8217;re not really setting great goals from the CEO level, down. They&#8217;re not focusing around what&#8217;s really going to propel the company forward. They usually lack a product vision. They are being measured for success based on output, rather than outcomes which tie right back to those goals. That never helps break the cycle. You can always increase an output, but it never really tells you if you&#8217;re providing value. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They also get stuck in this because they don&#8217;t really have a fully-functioning product management and strategy cadence to figure out what the right thing to build is, and then feed that into their agile development processes. Agile development processes are more about how you work together. Not about trying to figure out what to build, and is it the right thing to build. We need to marry those two sides together so that we have a fully functioning system throughout the company, where we&#8217;re building the right things and we&#8217;re building them really, really well, and getting them out there to our customers very efficiently. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: One of the concepts around product strategy that I&#8217;ve always struggled with is, when can a PM really start to take ownership of it? How have you found that some of the work you&#8217;ve done at the Product Institute ties to that? Do you find that you have to take students through a lot of how to think like a product manager first, before they can get through product strategy?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah, I think it starts with, how you define strategy, too. What is a product strategy? How do you come up with it? How do you define it for the rest of the company? Where I see people get stuck, especially executives, is they think that product strategy is like a plan. I&#8217;m gonna build these features at this time, and it&#8217;s all going to ship on these dates. Strategy is not supposed to be that. It&#8217;s supposed to be a framework that helps you make decisions. Good strategy is about giving a people a framework in which they can look at the decisions they&#8217;re about to make, and then be able to decide whether or not it fits with the product they&#8217;re going to build. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When we teach our product managers about strategy, we set it up a little bit differently. We say, there&#8217;s a few components of your strategy you should know and that you want to refine, but you don&#8217;t need to know the answers to all the strategy right off the bat. You have to do some research. You have to do some experimentation to really build a great strategy. For strategy, when you look at the vision of a product, you want to ask: what value will this deliver for our customer, and through what means? What are the principles that we build this product based off? You want to create a cohesive vision that people understand.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Now, sometimes you can&#8217;t do that right off the bat. If I&#8217;m faced with a new problem, and I have no idea what that problem is, I have no idea how to solve it; I can&#8217;t just pick a vision out of thin air. I have to explore the problem more. Maybe some experimentation to figure out what&#8217;s the right product to build, right? The vision for some of these larger things, they might evolve over time. I have to look at the market. I have to look at how we have more advantages based on how we build it and what channels we use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Then the other part is really about aligning your goals. Strategy&#8217;s all about reaching the vision. How do we build to reach our business goals, while also looking at the vision for the product and building in line for that? To me, it&#8217;s a system of having great vision, goals that you want to hit, that help you align and prioritize what I should do in order to get to that vision. Also, some constraints. What do we not want to do? I think that&#8217;s not something that we talk a lot about in product management, but it&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s important to prioritize, in light of things we don&#8217;t want to do, so we&#8217;re not distracted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: What are some of the hardest lessons, product managers who go through the Product Institute, need to learn in order to think like a PM? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> I really think it&#8217;s about analyzing where you are, and stopping to think that way. One of the tools that I try to teach everybody is called the Product Kata. It&#8217;s a framework based off of Toyota Kata, which was basically a framework that Toyota used to help all their employees improve. They would analyze where they are, where they wanted to go, and come up with ways to improve the way they worked together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I took some of the foundations of that and created the Product Kata in product management for that. What the Product Kata does, is it asks you a series of questions, and you do this repeatedly. It trains you to think like a product manager. So, the first thing is set the goal. Then it asks, &#8220;In relation to that goal, where are you now?&#8221; We talk through that. Then you ask, &#8220;What are the biggest obstacles standing in the way of me reaching that goal?&#8221; So, what questions do we have to answer before we feel confident making another move. We look at those and choose the biggest question we have to answer, out of those obstacles, and then we ask, &#8220;What can we do to learn it?&#8221; So, maybe it&#8217;s user research. Maybe it&#8217;s an experimentation. Maybe it&#8217;s gather data. We design a way to learn and answer that question, and then we ask, &#8220;What do we expect to happen after we run this experiment?&#8221; Do we expect to have data back? Do we think we know what the answer is? Then, we run it and at the end, we ask, &#8220;What did you learn?&#8221; Then, we do this again starting with, &#8220;Where are we now?&#8221; Did we move closer to our goal? Did we go further away? Are we still at the same spot? And, we keep repeating it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, the Product Kata is something that you practice habitually. It&#8217;s something that you should do every couple of days, every week, depending on how long it takes to answer that question. You meet afterwards and step through it. As a coach, what I do with my product managers, is ask them all those questions to help them think through and formulate their thought process. To me, that&#8217;s really thinking like a product manager. It&#8217;s breaking down, what I have to learn. Where am I right now in comparison to my goal? What is something I can do to get more information?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Can you give us a couple examples or exercises that people can do to think like a PM that can make the learning curve less steep? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> With product managers, what I would say is, start by really looking at what you&#8217;re currently working on. How do you know it&#8217;s the right thing to build? Do you have goals? Do you know what the problem is? Do you understand it? The first thing you could possibly do is really diagnose where you are. To me, there&#8217;s a couple stages of product management that we all have to go through, and then apply the right tools to it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The first one is goal setting. Do we know what the goal is, or what the business outcomes are for this product? If we don&#8217;t, we have to do figure out what those are. The next one is really, problem exploration. Do we know what problem we&#8217;re solving to help reach those goals? If not, that&#8217;s where we do user research. That&#8217;s where we get in touch with our customers. That&#8217;s where we pull data. That helps us break down and narrow our scope. Once we know that, we define the problem and we move into solution exploration mode. This is really asking, &#8220;Do I know what the right solution is to build?&#8221; If I don&#8217;t, I have to experiment around it.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> For example, I like to use a checkout page. Checkout pages have been explored. People have experimented with them. There are pretty well-known best practices in the industry of how to create checkout pages. Maybe I take some of those best practices. I implement a checkout page, launch it, and start measuring to see my results. Maybe I don&#8217;t have to spend more time doing smaller experiments where I&#8217;m really crafting a unique user experience, right? I can just implement something. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Being in solution exploration mode, that&#8217;s </span><span class="s1">where you make those decisions. Can I just choose the best practices if it&#8217;s a very well-known problem? Or, do I have to spend more time really exploring what the best solution is? Once you know what the best solution is, you define it. What is the vision of this solution? Then you break it down and start going through your processes to really build and launch it in incremental value, so that you can iterate on it and get feedback.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, any product manager who&#8217;s starting out and really trying to figure out how to think like a product manager, I would tell them to really go back through those phases and figure out what phase they should be in, and if you&#8217;re using the right tools. You shouldn&#8217;t be building features in production code yet, if you&#8217;re really not sure what the solution is. You have to spend some time discovering that, mapping it out, maybe doing some prototypes or doing some other types of experiments. So, that&#8217;s my advice for anybody who is trying to figure out who to think like a product manager. It&#8217;s about really diagnosing where you are, and applying the right tools, depending on that phase. If you&#8217;re in problem exploration mode, you should not be making prototypes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Absolutely. I&#8217;m curious to know how you think about what you just said in the context of B2B versus B2C? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> I always get this question about if my advice is applicable for B2B versus B2C. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s really a big difference between how you approach these phases I&#8217;m talking about. These phases still exist between B2B, and B2C. How you approach them might be a little bit different between B2C, and B2B. I don&#8217;t think you go any faster through them. I don&#8217;t think you go any slower, depending on your context. It&#8217;s really about the problem you&#8217;re solving.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One of the clients I&#8217;m working with, they&#8217;re building software for healthcare. It&#8217;s a really complicated, big software, and it&#8217;s a massive team building it, but they still approach all of the same patterns that we talked through. You have to because in B2B, there&#8217;s more pressure because you have clients banging on your door to sign contracts, but requesting features. What we try to get all of our product managers to do, is take a step back and say, &#8220;You know they might be asking for this feature, but it might not solve their problem.&#8221; It&#8217;s never the customer&#8217;s job to solve their own problems. It&#8217;s their job to provide you information about the problem. It&#8217;s our job, as product managers, to interpret that and figure out, what the best solution is for them and for our company. How do we get business and customer value? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Even though you do have customers who are banging on your door and complaining, they&#8217;re there. They&#8217;re human beings. They&#8217;re not anonymous, like some of the people in B2C environments. You have to, as a product manager, learn to synthesize that information and really get to the root of the problem.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One of my colleagues told me the other day, there was somebody from marketing. They said, &#8220;I worked with an amazing product manager on one of your teams the other day, and I was telling him the feedback we were getting from the clients.&#8221; He was able to sit there and say, &#8220;Okay, I know he&#8217;s asking for these tools and these features, but what I think he&#8217;s really saying is that he needs to be able to accomplish it. Am I right?&#8221; And he was right. So, he kept seeing into the problem to really figure out what was the root cause there, instead of just saying, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, we can build a solution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Where I see some new product managers get into the trap is when they dismiss the feedback coming from customers because they say, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s giving me a solution. He should be giving me problems.&#8221; So, with my new product managers, I have to tell them, even if somebody comes to you with a solution, that&#8217;s not their fault. Don&#8217;t blame them for coming to you with a solution. That&#8217;s how people think. What your job is, is to sit there with that person, really understand why he picked that solution. Why they have that problem? How do I understand better? What&#8217;s causing him to ask for this? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s really the most important part of getting into B2B versus B2C. You just might get more feedback that&#8217;s more pressing, but you really shouldn&#8217;t change your approach. You would change your approach, probably in testing phases. You might change the tools you use. You might change the way that you release things. You might change the way that you get feedback, or synthesize that information. That might be different than B2C, but the approach and the phases are all still the same. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: You talked a lot about goal setting and I was wondering, is there a framework that you use around goal setting that can help product managers, get out of the Build Trap? Is there anything that you&#8217;ve seen work effectively for that? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> Getting out of the Build Trap, that&#8217;s a long systemic process. The first thing is to start with the goal. That&#8217;s why I harp on it so much. A lot of people can find that they make a lot of progress getting out of the build trap, just setting a goal. In my school, I teach people about the HEART and AARRR metrics, just as two examples of how to break down product metrics. Where I think new product managers struggle with that is, they look at too many metrics. If you give them frameworks, they&#8217;ll want to measure everything, but what I think you want to do with any framework, or with any of those goal-setting metrics, like HEART or AARRR, is to really break them down and figure out what&#8217;s relevant for me and my context. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Sometimes, as a new product manager working on a small little sliver of a feature, some of those frameworks might actually not apply to your small little area. It might apply to a much broader area of your product, and you have to zoom out first, look at the holistic level, and then figure out what do you control in that system. It&#8217;s really breaking down those types of metrics into a way that makes sense for your context.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: What are HEART and AARRR metrics, just for the audience? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> AARRR metrics is something that Dave McClure started. It&#8217;s called, Pirate metrics. I think of it as funnel analysis. It goes over acquisition, activation, retention, revenue and referral. These can change order, depending on what type of product you have. Acquisition could be adoption of a feature or product. Retention is how many times people come back and keep using it. With AARRR metrics, you&#8217;re looking at the funnel. I try to get people to break down the funnels and user flow through the system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> With HEART metrics, that&#8217;s what Google created that&#8217;s a little bit more UX-centered. That&#8217;s about looking at happiness, engagement, adoption, retention and past success. That, I think of too, as health metrics for your product. How do you know if your product&#8217;s up and running? Are people actually adopting your product? Are they happy with it? Are they accomplishing the task that they set out to do? Is the job getting done that they set out to do?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I try to tell my product managers to do is rip them apart and figure out which pieces you implement. For example, when I was working with a company, my goal was only around acquisition. I know that everything that I have to do is trying to get more people to sign up for a site. Then, I was able to take that and say, &#8220;Okay, for my scope of the area, which is just after people land on our website, until the moment they sign up, how can I influence acquisition within that scope?&#8221; Then, I&#8217;m trying to figure out what problems exist with people coming to our website and signing up. Why aren&#8217;t they signing up? What are the metrics I can influence in that? What I did was I looked at that and found out that conversion rate was pretty low. So my metrics were influencing conversion rate to go up. I took these high level metrics that I&#8217;m talking about, with AARRR, and then I broke that down into something smaller, that was more measurable for me, and I concentrated on that and set it as my goal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">Just to tie things up here, what was one thing that you wished you had learned at the beginning of your PM career, that now is a fundamental part of PI?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> I think it&#8217;s really about how you come up with solutions. Throughout Product Institute, we really stress, especially when you&#8217;re getting into solution exploration and trying to figure out what to build with your team. I find a lot of people who are new to product management, or a lot of companies who are new to product management, treat product managers sometimes as not part of the team, which to me, is a crazy thing. When I was first getting into product management, I was told it was my job to come up with the solutions and hand it off to the development team. What I learned throughout my career was, that wasn&#8217;t my job at all. My job was more to point my team in the right direction and then we, together, figured out the best solutions. Four or five brains is way better than just one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> That&#8217;s something that I stress throughout all of Product Institute. It&#8217;s not the product manager&#8217;s job, alone, to come up with all these ideas. It&#8217;s your job to provide the structure in which people should think. For example, if I know that I&#8217;m in solution exploration mode and I know what I have to learn next, let me bring that for my team, and then see what ideas they have for how we can quickly learn it.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> When I was working at one company, my tech lead came up with a way that we were able to learn on that conversion example. Why people weren&#8217;t signing up. It was nothing that I would&#8217;ve ever thought of implementing in my life, and it wasn&#8217;t really a huge tech problem. It was a user research problem. We had no idea how to get in touch with our customers. He researched it like crazy and was like, &#8220;Hey, I found this thing that we could put on our site with a few lines of JavaScript and we could probably get the answers you&#8217;re looking for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> If I never let my developers or my team into that process, I would never have got the answers I needed. That&#8217;s something that I really try to stress for all product managers. It&#8217;s not about you. It&#8217;s not about your ideas. It&#8217;s about the team&#8217;s ideas. You help everybody make decisions. You provide the framework in which you make decisions. You narrow people&#8217;s focus, and you keep them on track. But you don&#8217;t have to come up with all the solution ideas yourself, first. You have to open it up to your team, and have a collaborative approach to it. </span><span class="s1">A</span><span class="s1">s we get through Product Institute, I really stress, every step of the way, that if you&#8217;re doing user research, bring your developers to it.

You&#8217;re going to make the final call, but you don&#8217;t have to come in there with all the answers. It&#8217;s not you versus the team.

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: That&#8217;s awesome. I think that also sort of sounds like the definition of a leader. Those are sometimes interchangeable with being a product manager.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"> Just to close out, Melissa, where can our Product to Product audience find you online? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> Yeah. If you want to follow me on Twitter, it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/lissijean" target="_blank">@lissijean</a>. (It&#8217;s my nickname from my mother.) I blog at <a href="https://melissaperri.com/" target="_blank">melissaperri.com</a>.

We have open enrollment and a great community of over 500 people talking to each other on Slack, exchanging knowledge. We&#8217;d love to have everybody. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Latif: Thank you so much, and we will definitely direct people your way. Really appreciate your time, and thank you so much for coming on the podcast. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Melissa:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, it was great talking to you!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Welcome to the first episode of <strong>season two of</strong> <a href="https://hubs.ly/H0bmryS0" target="_blank"><strong>Product to Product</strong></a>, a podcast for / by product people!</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to the episode below:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/product-to-product/id1293415837?mt=2" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-4037 alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-apple.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a><a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Is7ibqzwhkqszuin6l2li7f3in4" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-4036 size-full alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/link-google.png" alt="" width="289" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><iframe style="border: none;" src="//html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/6383067/height/90/theme/custom/autoplay/no/autonext/no/thumbnail/yes/preload/no/no_addthis/no/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/32c7c0/" width="100%" height="90" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">For our second season we&#8217;ve decided to shake things up. This season, each episode will focus on a specific theme: <strong>t</strong><strong>he human side of product</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ll be having candid convos with product people who will be sharing <strong>real-world, practical stories of navigating the human-related aspects of the product space</strong>. That means we&#8217;ll discuss topics like handling tricky relationships with non-technical team members, how to effectively think like a product manger, and how to disrupt human behaviour with human-centered AI design (just to name a few topics!).</p>
<p class="p1">For our first episode of the season we&#8217;re joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lulucheng21" target="_blank"><strong>Lulu Cheng</strong></a>, product manager on the Discovery team at <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank"><strong>Pinterest</strong></a>. When Lulu first joined Pinterest in 2015, her primary objective was to ship quickly and hit her KPIs. But as she got more comfortable in her role—and the product space—she realized she wasn&#8217;t really asking her team, &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So she made it a personal priority to focus on her team&#8217;s &#8220;wellness.&#8221; Was her team motivated? How was team morale? How are they handling the stress that comes with the role? She realized <strong>healthy team members = better team performance = a better product</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">So Lulu spoke to my colleague Eleni Deacon about <strong>concrete and proactive steps she takes to put her team&#8217;s well-being front and centre</strong>. Plus: what does this focus on team wellness ultimately mean for her team&#8217;s overall performance and product strategy.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Hey Lulu, thanks so much for doing this. I&#8217;m really excited to talk to you today.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Hi, thanks so much for having me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Before we get started in the actual conversation, can you just tell me about yourself and your role at Pinterest, what do you do there?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I am a product manager on our discovery team. I&#8217;ve been at Pinterest for a little over two years now. Before that, I was at Dropbox, I was on the product marketing team there, and was one of the first marketing folks to join their growth team, where I did a mix of the marketing and product work, and that&#8217;s kind of where I first got my initial taste of product work. Before that, I spent some time at Microsoft up in Seattle, and in what feels like a very previous life now, I started out as an investment banker in New York, when I graduated from college. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So what do you do in your current role at Pinterest? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> On the discovery team, our charter is really to think about how we surface the best recommendations to Pinners. So that spans a number of different services in the app that includes home feed, search, a product called related pins, another product called visual search. So, it&#8217;s a pretty broad team, and then within that there&#8217;s a bunch of sub teams. So my focus is currently on the home feed product, and specifically working on a new type of recommendation that we&#8217;re hoping to ship to 100%. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Can you tell me about your specific team. How big is the team you work on? Give me the lay of the land of your team itself. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> It&#8217;s fluctuated over time, because that&#8217;s something unique about working on a feature that&#8217;s brand new. But in general, the team that I work with is unique in terms of other teams at Pinterest. There are some teams at Pinterest that are completely backend focused, and thinking exclusively about the quality of the recommendations that we surface. Then, there are other teams that are predominately more finance-focused, and thinking about how the actual features and user interactions on the different platforms play out.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"When you build that trust &amp; rapport over time, it makes it easier to navigate difficult times."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22When%20you%20build%20that%20trust%20%26%20rapport%20over%20time%2C%20it%20makes%20it%20easier%20to%20navigate%20difficult%20times.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3846' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The team that I&#8217;m on, what I really like about it is that it spans both of those sides. So, I get a chance to work on the backend side, and thinking about how we leverage a lot of our existing data pipelines to power this new type of recommendation we weren&#8217;t necessarily able to do a year ago. Then, also, on the front end side, what is the best way to surface that new type of recommendation to users? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But the team has been as large as probably eight engineers, and between engineering design, we had eight folks, which arguably for a product that isn&#8217;t live yet is actually a bit too many cooks in the kitchen. So, yeah, we&#8217;ve slimmed down over time, and primarily focused on the backend, actually.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Are you the only product manager on the team? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I am. I am the main PM, yep. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So, I know we&#8217;re going to be talking about wellness and prioritizing your team&#8217;s wellbeing during this conversation. I&#8217;m wondering, when you first started working on this project, what were your main objectives? What were your priorities right at the very beginning? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Our priorities in the beginning were really to figure out if we had a prototype that had legs. So, essentially the way that this project kind of spun up is it came out of a design sprint where one of the designers on our team basically asked “What if we had this UI mechanism on home feed that was able to push content to users when they came to the app?” So that&#8217;s a pretty simple, straightforward idea—a lot of products have this. But, how do we make that work for Pinterest? What&#8217;s the content that will be most relevant and compelling to pinners?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, we had this new UX paradigm, and we had a bunch of different options for different content that we could slot into it. We basically did a round of user research in the very beginning where we showed a bunch of different types of content to pinners to get their feedback on what they might find interesting. From there, we were able to basically pick one specific type of recommendation that performed particularly well in the qualitative research, and we also realized, we were pretty confident that we would be able to deliver on the expectation of the quality of content that pinners would expect—and that we would be able to reiterate on that going forward.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, I think that was a big milestone, and then from there, our goal has consistently been to find a way to surface these recommendations to pinners in a way that, at the moment when they&#8217;re going to find it most valuable, and to basically minimize distraction. Or, we use this term at Pinterest called cannibalization, where any time you introduce a new feature into the product, your ideal goal is that you incrementally increase the amount of time that people spend on your app, or how engaged people are. But, inevitably, there does end up being some surface trade off. So, that&#8217;s also been something that we&#8217;ve been thinking about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: When you first started, not even just in this role, but you can think back to earlier in your career, how did you prioritize the idea of wellbeing of your team and yourself? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> To be completely honest, that wasn&#8217;t something that I paid a lot of attention to when I first started out as a PM. My focus, when I first started, was really just trying to get a lot of, I guess in my mind, what I called the basics down. And also in transitioning from marketing to a pretty technical team at Pinterest, there was a lot of ramping up to do on just the technical backend side. So, I would say that it really hasn&#8217;t been until I started working on this more long-term feature, where it&#8217;s unfolding over a number of months, and it&#8217;s not completely certain whether or not it will even ship.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"That was when I realized how much the team picks up on each other’s emotional energy."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22That%20was%20when%20I%20realized%20how%20much%20the%20team%20picks%20up%20on%20each%20other%E2%80%99s%20emotional%20energy.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3846' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> There&#8217;s been a lot of ups and downs, and it&#8217;s been through that process that I&#8217;ve realized how important it is to keep a pulse on team morale, and momentum. The investment that you put in over the long run, like taking five minutes at the beginning of your team meeting every week to do a quick icebreaker, on the surface might feel like a waste of time. Why are you doing that? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But, it&#8217;s one of those things where I&#8217;ve learned a bunch of really interesting anecdotes and just personal things about my teammates that I don&#8217;t think I would have had a chance to learn otherwise. When you&#8217;re able to build that trust and rapport over time, it makes it easier to navigate difficult times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Can you tell me about the moment, or maybe an event that precipitated your interest in making a wellness a priority? Was there a particular experience that led to you being like, “Oh, I think I actually need to pay attention to this and focus on it?” </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I think it was more of a gradual realization. But there are actually a couple of moments that stand out. One is actually not even when I was at work, I was just catching up with a friend, and the question came up: how’s work going? I noticed that that was the first time where instead of answering that question from the perspective of how quickly are we moving, or what do our experiment dashboard data metrics look like, my actual first thought was to think about how does the team feel? How do all the individual members of my team feel? Do I feel like they are happy and feeling motivated? Even though our last experiment wasn&#8217;t super promising, does there still feel like there&#8217;s energy and excitement about the problem that we&#8217;re solving? I remember that was a little ah-ha moment for me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Then the second moment was after a team meeting, and someone like the product analyst on our team pinged me over Slack, afterwards. She was like, &#8220;Hey, are you feeling okay? I said, &#8220;Yeah, what prompted that question?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I felt like you were a bit quieter in our sync today.&#8221; That was when I realized how much the team picks up on each other&#8217;s emotional energy. And especially as the PM, when you&#8217;re in this position of leadership, and people are looking to you for direction, but also to set the overall tone of things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So once you realized that you wanted to prioritize having more personal connections and helping people feel good at work, where did you start? What were some of the first concrete steps you took?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I think that one on one&#8217;s with key members of your team they can be pretty informal or formal depending on the person. Every person on your team is going to have different preferences for how they like to communicate what motivates them. Why are they waking up every day to come into work? What are their longer term career aspirations? Do you know what those are? So, I think getting to a point where you have a good sense of what that is for each person on your team, and also how they like to work together. As a PM, I think it&#8217;s really your job to pick up on that, and to adapt how you communicate and interact with that person accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, yeah, if there&#8217;s an engineer on your team who is fond of walking outside, maybe that&#8217;s how you sync with them, or if there&#8217;s someone who really prefers just to do slack updates, that&#8217;s also great. I think that&#8217;s just getting up to speed on people&#8217;s individual preferences in terms of communication and what motivates them is important. Then zooming out, on a broader team level, there&#8217;s, I mentioned doing ice breakers during our team meeting. I think being super transparent and over communicating, so making sure that whatever decision is being discussed, you always choose the forum with the widest audience, like where it makes sense. I think that really helps to build just a sense of trust and inclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I&#8217;m curious about the one on one&#8217;s, how did you change your approach on one on ones? What were you doing before and what are you doing after, or now?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I think when you read about some of this stuff online, the kind of ground rule is, oh, you should try to have a one on one with almost every engineer on your team, let&#8217;s say. I think that while that definitely makes sense for some teams, I&#8217;ve realized, as a PM, and we joke, but part of your jobs is, a lot of times, just having meetings. But, from an engineer&#8217;s perspective, meetings often aren&#8217;t their favorite thing. So, I think just checking in with them, and being like, “Hey, I was thinking that it could be helpful for us to have a regular sync and check in with them all on the cadence that you would prefer.” Then, also, if their preference is “If there&#8217;s every anything that you need to get a status update on, just ping me over slack. I would prefer to do it that way.” That&#8217;s also totally fine—I’ll just make that mental note. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Do you use your one on ones mostly for status update type stuff, or is it more personal, what&#8217;s going on with you, how are you feeling? How do you balance that?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I would say, it&#8217;s situational, or I kind of go in and the time is very flexible. So, we&#8217;ll go in and, depending on where we are with the feature, how I kind of sense they’re feeling that day, how much we have to talk about, those things always kind of shift. But, for example, I had a recent one on one with one of the engineers on my team, and she had actually just spent that morning with our head of engineering who was hosting some product folks from We Chat that morning.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"You want to enjoy other people’s company; not just be a robot from meeting to meeting."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22You%20want%20to%20enjoy%20other%20people%E2%80%99s%20company%3B%20not%20just%20be%20a%20robot%20from%20meeting%20to%20meeting.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3846' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I was really interested just to hear how that had gone, and I could tell that she was also excited to impart some of what she had learned. So, we spent the bulk of our one on one actually just talking about that, and it was more higher level product talk. That’s one recent example. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: What about the ice breakers? Tell me a little bit about that. What do you do? Is it like games? Just kidding.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> People joke that making ice breakers is like a skill, and it&#8217;s something that I should list on my Linkedin profile. But I take genuine pleasure in coming up with what I feel like are pretty unique questions, or questions that will elicit stories. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> They&#8217;ve ranged. I try to keep them seasonal, so if it&#8217;s the holidays, or if it&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s day, like often they&#8217;ll be themed. But some of my favorites have been asking people about their earliest childhood memory, their worst roommate stories. Also, I&#8217;m realizing, this sounds a lot like dating profile questions, but it&#8217;s all the same! It’s in that same spirit of just getting to know people better. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Do you think, I feel like a feeling that I feel sometimes, and I know a lot of my colleagues feel, there&#8217;s just so many meetings, and meetings consume you. When you just want to get from one meeting to the next as quickly as you can, and there would potentially be resistance to the idea of spending five minutes talking about your childhood memories. What do you say to those people, and what is the value of making that investment in a meeting?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I think about this like the rainy day savings analogy. It&#8217;s one of those things where often you don&#8217;t, or oftentimes when you see the most payoff from something like this is when things start getting a bit bumpier, or there are decisions that come up that are a bit more controversial, and people have strong opinions. I think that when you “pay into this piggy bank” of just good rapport and getting to know your teammates on a more personal level, then there&#8217;s that underlying foundation of trust that then helps you weather the times when there are strong differences of opinion. I think that that&#8217;s definitely one piece of it. Then the other piece of it is just you spend so much time at work. You want to enjoy other people&#8217;s company; not just be a robot from meeting to meeting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: It almost sounds like the kind of thing where, like there could be a case made about how this is so off topic; it’s a waste of time. But then at the same time, it’s making the meeting more casual, and just not as work-related. I feel like it might make people more present. They get into the zone of the meting a little bit more because it starts with something that&#8217;s more personal and removes them from whatever they were doing two minutes before coming to that room.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Yeah. I think that&#8217;s a great point, and I think there&#8217;s definitely a difference in just the energy when you sit down and you know the first few minutes are going to be just more casual and fun, and you expect to laugh. I generally almost always laugh during our icebreakers. I think that&#8217;s awesome.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Have you started to see results from contributing to your emotional piggy bank at work? What are the results you&#8217;ve started to see?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Recently we had a moment on the team where we were at this juncture where we had to make a decision, and there were a lot of strong opinions on two sides of the issue. It was an interesting learning experience for me, because I think this is where my leadership style or natural state is to be more consensus-driven when it comes to decisions. I think that this particular decision, it was one where there were strong opinions from a design perspective, but when we zoomed out, the actual impact to pinners, based on our experiment data, basically it was a coin toss. Either route that we went down, there wasn&#8217;t a huge difference in terms of our metrics.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"Something I believe is, the more informal and frequent the feedback, the better. "</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Something%20I%20believe%20is%2C%20the%20more%20informal%20and%20frequent%20the%20feedback%2C%20the%20better.%20%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3846' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, there were strong opinions on both sides, and then later, when we were doing a post mortem of what had happened, there were also some tough conversations that we had to have a team around how do we work together? How do we make decisions more efficiently? Those were some of the harder conversations I&#8217;ve had at Pinterest. So I think that it would have been a lot harder to have those conversations without having established just that trust and that rapport going into it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: This maybe is a segue from what you&#8217;re saying, but I know one of the topics that you&#8217;re really passionate about is feedback, giving it, getting it. What role do you think feedback plays in someone&#8217;s sense of wellness at work?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> I think this is changing, but I think a lot of times feedback is still relegated to twice a year performance review conversations. I think under that model, if things just build up over months and months, and then you have all of this emotion and expectation and anticipation going into this one conversation. Something I believe is, the more informal and frequent the feedback, the better. I would much rather get the feedback in that way when the stakes are much smaller, and the context from whatever you&#8217;re referring to is still fresh in people&#8217;s minds. It just makes for more productive feedback.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How do you encourage your team members to give you feedback?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> The best way, I think, to do that is to keep asking for it, and to reiterate the fact that you are welcome and, you&#8217;re inviting their feedback. Yeah, you sincerely welcome their feedback, and I think also that it&#8217;s helpful if you can make that request specific, right? So if a coworker comes to you and is just like, “Hey Lulu, I&#8217;m really trying to get a promotion next cycle, and I&#8217;d love to get some feedback from you on how things have been going.” That&#8217;s a very broad request, and that kind of puts the burden on the other person to sit there and be like, hmm, okay, what&#8217;s worth flagging to this person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Whereas, it&#8217;s a very different thing if you go to a coworker and you say, “Hey, I&#8217;m really trying to work on my public speaking and presentation skills. So during the next meeting that we have together, if I have to present something, can you just pay attention to how confident I seem, or my volume? Am I making enough eye contact?” Get specific and concrete, and that makes it so much easier for the person to give you that feedback. So I think honing in on identifying the areas that you&#8217;re trying to improve, and then identifying maybe people on your team or in the broader company at large that you feel like do a really good job at the thing that you&#8217;re trying to get better at and seeing if they&#8217;d be willing to give you some feedback. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So, I know that you&#8217;ve been working on a product that&#8217;s been a long term project. I&#8217;m wondering how your emphasis on your team&#8217;s wellbeing has impacted your ability to actually ship. What impact has it had on the concrete product itself? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> This focus on wellness has helped the team be pretty generative when it comes to ideas to test. It&#8217;s also resulted in an environment where people are very comfortable speaking up and expressing their point of view. So I think we&#8217;re able to get a lot of diverse perspectives that come out of that kind of environment, and I think that&#8217;s helped the team, especially recently when we&#8217;ve been really trying a bunch of experiments in parallel. It&#8217;s helped us to come up with different approaches for solving something that we might not have considered before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So, I think that&#8217;s been one concrete thing. I think another aspect of it is just as a PM, I&#8217;m thinking about it has been a long journey. I was looking at some of our experiment metrics, yesterday, actually, and there&#8217;s a variant that&#8217;s looking promising. So in terms of next steps, we can either continue iterating on that experience. There are definitely a bunch of variables and things that we can change that I think would make the metrics look even better. But at that point, you&#8217;re thinking about, “Okay, we are nine months in, and actually, probably the thing that will be best for motivation and for morale is to just get this variant shipped and iterate from there once we&#8217;re live to everyone.” So, that&#8217;s the call that you&#8217;re making, that&#8217;s very much influenced by how the team is feeling. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How does your team manage stresses that might come from outside your team? I know for product people, they&#8217;re dealing with a lot of stakeholders, and that can often be one of the bigger pain point. How do you manage that on your team? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> It&#8217;s a tricky balance, for sure. So, there are three buckets of external stakeholders. So, there are teams whom we need to collaborate with to reach our goals. There are teams that want to partner with us to leverage what we&#8217;re building, to meet their goals. Then there&#8217;s leadership, and there&#8217;s the executive team, and the direction they&#8217;d like the team to point towards. So, I think each of those three groups requires their own approach. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the most part, like with other teams that we collaborate with, I let the team basically run pretty autonomously there, and to reach out to the different engineers. </span><span class="s1">Then, the second group of other potential teams in the company where I want to collaborate on something that&#8217;s mutually beneficial, those are always fun to think about. That f</span><span class="s1">or the most part, tends to be pretty self-driven from the team.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"This focus on wellness has helped the team be pretty generative when it comes to ideas to test."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22This%20focus%20on%20wellness%20has%20helped%20the%20team%20be%20pretty%20generative%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20ideas%20to%20test.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3846' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, on the leadership side, that has been one area where I&#8217;ve spent more of my time. Until this thing has launched, it&#8217;s unproven. So I think you&#8217;re constantly having to justify why are we spending these resources on this thing? What will it unlock for us in the future? </span><span class="s1">So that communication of what the team is doing, the vision, and then also just the transparency and the consistent communication and updates, I think, has been something where I&#8217;ve invested a lot of my time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How has focusing on your team&#8217;s motivation and morale impacted the way that you care for yourself? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> So, I think after that conversation that we talked about earlier, where the analyst on my team pinged me, and she asked “How are you doing?” I realized that whether I know it or not that my personal energy communicates a lot to the team. So I realized, okay, it&#8217;s important for me to come into work and to be energized, and well rested. That&#8217;s important. I think sometimes you forget just how much role your exterior presence can have on others. So, I think that&#8217;s been a good reminder that sometimes just taking a little break and stepping away, or making sure that you&#8217;re well rested is also important. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: If there was another team that wanted to make this their focus, make wellbeing their focus, what small actions do you think they could take on right now to get the ball rolling? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Well, I think we&#8217;ve established that I love icebreakers, so I think that&#8217;s a pretty-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: That&#8217;s the first step, is break the ice. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Yeah. Just let your curiosity guide you. What do you want to know more about your teammates? I think it starts from a genuine place of curiosity about the people on your team and who you work with, and just a genuine desire to get to know them better. Yeah, so I think that that&#8217;s the most important thing, and then I think what we talked about earlier in terms of really getting a good grasp on how everyone on your team likes to work, and what motivates them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Especially when you&#8217;re joining a new team, it&#8217;s really important to, in those initial introductory meetings, to get to know that about everyone on your team, so you have that foundation going forward. Then, I think over time I would encourage other product managers to think about when someone asks you the question, like, how are things going? How&#8217;s the team doing? In addition to thinking about how quickly you guys are moving, what the metrics say, I would encourage you to think about the morale of your team and how that feels, and to factor that in into that answer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: So Lulu, can I get you to tell us where we can find you online? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Yes. I&#8217;m on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lulu_cheng" target="_blank">@lulu_cheng</a>, and I also have a newsletter that I send out, it&#8217;s a tiny letter. I think it&#8217;s just <a href="https://tinyletter.com/lulucheng" target="_blank">tinyletter.com/lulucheng</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I have a confession to make. I&#8217;m on that. I signed up for it two years ago when I first started my job, and now I read about your life and it&#8217;s great. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Oh, that makes me so happy! Yeah, I was just about to say it&#8217;s not actually really work focused, but I talk about a lot of the feedback, and personal growth stuff, I think that&#8217;s something that bleeds over into my </span><span class="s1">work life. So if that&#8217;s your jam, I call that the truest me on the internet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Hm, I like that. Lulu, thank you so much for chatting with us, I really appreciate it. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Lulu:</strong> Thank you so much, Eleni, this was a lot of fun.</span></p>

<p>Hotjar is on a mission to democratize user data and feedback by making their analytics platform accessible to everyone—no matter how small their website.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;re a startup success story that you don’t hear too often. They’re based in Malta, a tiny island in the Mediterranean, and in 30 months, they bootstrapped their way to over 200,000 users and $10 million in annual revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An integral part of their success is their freemium pricing model. Their free forever plan makes it possible for anyone to use Hotjar without ever paying a cent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmunk&#8217;s Eleni spoke to Marc to found out why they decided to build a free forever plan, how it impacts product decisions and how it contributed to their rapid revenue growth.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Eleni: Hey Marc, thanks so much for doing this—we really appreciate you joining us today.</b></p>
<p><strong>Marc:</strong> Hey! I am really happy to be here. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><b>Eleni: Can you start by telling us a little bit about what Hotjar does, your role there and how it&#8217;s evolved since you guys first started?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m one of the founders of Hotjar, and we started back in 2014. It started as a bold vision to change the way the web is built by democratizing user data and feedback. Early on, before we actually worked at Hotjar, all the founders were makers. We all loved building stuff and we all, individually, used different tools to help us figure out how to improve what we were building. We used tools that allowed us to record visitors and see how they were acting. Other tools allowed us to see heat maps. We often tried to reach out to customers to get their feedback and understand what they liked and what they didn&#8217;t like about what we were building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem back then, however, was that most of these tools were actually geared towards the enterprise market. They were super expensive. You couldn&#8217;t really afford to have all the tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started to build Hotjar, it was at the time when we knew that hosting costs were decreasing. We saw an opportunity in the market to build a tool that combined all of these important tools, that we found important, at a very cheap price point—and to actually make it available for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, myself, started off as a developer. My role changed from developer to recruitment. I was just focusing on building the team. And more recently, maybe just over a year ago, I started slowly moving to product. As the team started to grow, there was more of a need to have some structure and product management.</span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: We’re going to take a deep dive into how you built your freemium model—but first, can you walk us through how you view &#8220;freemium&#8221;?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, our plan wasn&#8217;t to have a freemium. At a very early stage, we thought that we could have a very low price point to appeal to a wider market. We were just going to go with a $29 plan with a free trial that allowed users to try the software. If they wanted to keep using it then they would pay that monthly fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started the free beta, we began by collecting loads of email addresses for people who were interested in using the product. When we actually launched the product (the beta), we then slowly started inviting these people to use the product. We realized that all that free usage was actually having quite a positive effect the number of users who were subscribing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were creating this big group of fans, people who loved using the product, who would then go on and refer their friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the kind of network effect, and we found that to be extremely powerful in those early few months when the product was completely free. That’s how we decided that we should go the freemium route.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><hr /><p><em>"Freemium is not a bare-bones version of the tool."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Freemium%20is%20not%20a%20bare-bones%20version%20of%20the%20tool.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3787' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t think of freemium as a way of providing a bare-bones version of the tool for free. What we want to do is actually make the freemium plan as good as possible so that we get more users. And we&#8217;ve kind of used a combination of value-based pricing and cost-based pricing for the people who are paying us—those who have bigger sites and who can afford more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you have a small site—like a blog—and you&#8217;re never going to need that much space or storage, then in our opinion you don&#8217;t need to pay for it. You should get to use Hotjar for free. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Do you think a lot of companies that have a freemium model see it the way that you do—or do more companies see their free plan as a bare-bones version of the product that doesn’t actually offer as much value? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve seen both techniques being done. I have seen companies where, to them, the free tool is kind of the secondary concern—in the sense that all the changes they&#8217;re making are simply based on what their paying customers want. We think that is kind of dangerous. You do need to listen to what your paying customers want, but ultimately you shouldn&#8217;t completely ignore people who aren&#8217;t paying. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: You mentioned how you guys launched with a free beta. I&#8217;m wondering if you can give us an overview of how you guys went to market. How did Hotjar reach the public? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When five founders got together, we tried to define what we thought the first version of Hotjar would look like. We literally just got a Google Doc and listed everything that we thought was important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point, we had seen a few viral marketing campaigns before from other companies—and when I say viral I mean the sort of campaigns where you get somebody to sign up for something and then if they refer friends they move up in position to access the product. It was something that we&#8217;ve always kind of wanted to do and we thought would be ideal to test out for Hotjar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, we built a landing page on hotjar.com which essentially got people to sign up—put in their email and end up in a beta queue. Then, based on how many people they referred Hotjar to they would move up in the queue. We had some offers too—for example, the top hundred would get a free lifetime business plan and we had some t-shirts to give away. We tried to gamify the experience of this beta queue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we even built anything, we had worked on some screenshots of what we thought the product would look like—at this point, the product didn&#8217;t even exist. We added these screenshots to show exactly what people would get by signing up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on, we saw a lot of activity on Twitter. People were tweeting, trying to get others to subscribe because of this inbuilt viral loop that we had created. That was proving to be extremely powerful. I think we got most of the initial signups through this viral effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This early-access list launched in July of 2014 and by August we already had close to 20,000 emails. This was extremely positive because it&#8217;s a validation of what we&#8217;re doing. It kind of told us: okay, we’re working on something that people actually want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we launched our beta in September, just a few months after we had started collecting these emails. The platform didn&#8217;t even include all the tools we have today, and most of the tools were extremely basic. </span></p>
<p>We didn’t invite everyone on the list into the product right away—just the first thousand people. We also continued to collect emails on our landing page. That resulted in the queued up people trying to refer just so that they could make the next batch of invites. And then in effect, by October—just a month after—I think we had about 35,000 emails ready in the system.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward towards the end of the year: we had invited roughly 7,000 users. We had chosen the first of April 2015 as the official launch date. That was the date we were going to go commercial and actually start charging customers. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: When you guys were developing the beta, what were the points of discussion? Was there any debate about whether this was a good idea or not? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The reason we were able to launch with a free beta was that a few of the founders had personally invested their own funds. This gave us a bit of a runway, and we had some funds to inject into marketing and give ourselves a salary. That made the decision quite easy in the sense that we felt it was super important for us to do a free beta. It gave us an opportunity to see actual users use the product. To be honest, in those first few months, we relied on user feedback to decide how to build specific parts of the product.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><hr /><p><em>"We relied on user feedback to decide how to build specific parts of the product."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22We%20relied%20on%20user%20feedback%20to%20decide%20how%20to%20build%20specific%20parts%20of%20the%20product.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3787' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
<p><b>Eleni: You were leading engineering at the time, what technical considerations did you have to keep in mind?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We probably should have put a bit more thought into this one. When we started to build Hotjar, we just didn&#8217;t imagine how quickly it would grow. We built it in a way that we thought would kind of scale enough. We realized quite quickly that we had to change parts of the infrastructure and the way certain features work, purely because they were not scaling upwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to think of having scaling issues as a nice thing to have, but also a limitation. We have had quite a few instances where we&#8217;ve had to re-engineer parts of our infrastructure just because we haven&#8217;t really built something that would scale to that extent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do think that it is probably bad, straight off, to build something that is extremely scalable, because the reality is that you don&#8217;t want to invest too much time into building the perfect platform if you don&#8217;t actually manage to get it to one million users. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: How did people initially react when you first launched this? What was the reaction from both your users and yourselves? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to use a tool called Intercom, which is pretty much an industry standard now. We had Intercom inside the app, and every time somebody logged in we could send them a message and they could message us back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time somebody signed up for the free beta, we wanted to have a conversation with them to get to know why they&#8217;re using certain features and what they like about it. Early on, I&#8217;d say, a lot of people were excited about the fact that they instantly got access to all of these features for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing that lots of users actually commented on was that they didn&#8217;t realize that a few of these web technologies were even possible. One of the features is the recording feature, where basically you can watch users interact with your site. A lot of users didn&#8217;t actually realize that doing something like that is actually possible. It kind of makes sense, because these type of features were actually previously available for the bigger companies with steeper pockets because they were so expensive. We suddenly took something that was super enterprise and made it available to anyone, really. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: When you first started the beta, how were you thinking about eventually monetizing and creating paid plans? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t spend too much time on this, so I think it was just a half hour discussion. In hindsight, perhaps we should have spent a little more time but we always knew we wanted this $29 dollar plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, as I mentioned earlier, the initial plan was to have just one plan and not have a free version. But then we realized the importance of having free members and giving Hotjar to as many people as possible because it supported our vision. And something that we didn&#8217;t plan for happened. We went commercial on the April 1 and we offered everyone a free two-week trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We told them that they would have to start paying two weeks after we went commercial. What happened, unfortunately, and kind of fortunately at the same time, was some people actually started to pay immediately—even before their trial was over. We didn&#8217;t actually have everything ready for payments because we just assumed people would complete their trial before paying us. So yeah, I remember the first few days after the commercial launch we were quite stressed trying to get stuff done manually. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Eventually you guys launched with not just a $29 plan, but several different tiers. Can you walk us through your pricing model right now, and tell us how you landed on your current model?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently we have a freemium plan, and that is basically free forever. With that plan, we do have some limitations on the account. For instance, you can only store up to 300 recordings and up to three heat maps. Then we also have the Plus Plan, which is the $29 plan, where users can store as many heat maps and recordings as they want. Besides that, we also have a Business Plan, which is $89 per month. From that point on, prices change based on the amount of traffic they have. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: How do you prioritize what you build when the bulk of your users aren&#8217;t paying users? How do you make those decisions? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We have clearly defined what we want to achieve over the next few years in terms of functionality, and where we see the product going. We also rely on user feedback. We are an extremely user-centric company. We review feedback often. And as much as possible, we try to take it into consideration when prioritizing what to do next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use a tool called Receptive to store customer feedback, and in reality, if you look up top ten requests between free users and customers there isn&#8217;t that much difference. They&#8217;re asking for the same things, which makes our life much easier. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Has there ever been a time when there was a tension between your high-level vision of democratizing analytics and your needs to build a product that also makes money?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve been quite lucky from the start. I think we were profitable in month two after we went commercial. We&#8217;ve been growing roughly 6-7% month-on-month. We&#8217;ve never really been at the point where we&#8217;ve second-guessed ourselves because we just need to make money as a result. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: How did that get you to profitability so quickly? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Because of the free beta, we had months of feedback from our users, which helped us shape how we wanted the product to look. Essentially, when we got the actual launch, we had a product that users really grew to love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were also quite fast at implementing changes. We&#8217;d look at what people were asking from us, and within a week or two we&#8217;d actually have that feature live. We made it a point to manually contact all the users that specifically asked for something to tell them it was implemented. That won us a lot of fans.</span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: What is the hardest part of managing a freemium product as a product manager? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that we build needs to scale extremely well. We can&#8217;t afford to launch something that could break quite easily.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><hr /><p><em>"Everything that we build needs to scale extremely well."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Everything%20that%20we%20build%20needs%20to%20scale%20extremely%20well.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3787' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
<p><b>Eleni: As a product manager, what do you find to be the most gratifying part of offering your product for free? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As soon as we deploy something, we know that thousands of users are instantly seeing it. We actually start getting hundreds of people sending us feedback. That is extremely satisfying, and something I think that anyone involved in a product should be proud of. You can work on something that is actually affecting thousands of people. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: What opportunities do you think Hotjar would have missed if you had launched with that $29 plan and never did the freemium model at all? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My gut feeling is that we probably wouldn&#8217;t have grown as fast as we did. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have had this big group of fans that we have today. We&#8217;re lucky to be in a situation where we have a lot of users who really love the brand, and I think that is something that we would have missed out on if we completely eliminated the freemium model. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Hotjar is really interesting because you’re completely bootstrapped. Can you speak to the kind of paradoxical idea that offering your tool for free can actually help you build revenue?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you build a product that can scale, it&#8217;s fine to invest a lot in your freemium because, naturally, what&#8217;s gonna happen is that the 20% are going to start paying. They’ll support the freemium plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the second consideration is that you need to obviously look at what your costs are—luckily for us, we started Hotjar at a time when hosting costs were going down and it became super affordable to store data. If you do have a product where the costs are a bit higher, then you might be in a situation where you can not afford to have a freemium plan. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Do you think free forever is sustainable forever? </b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the paid plans cover the cost. We&#8217;d like to leave the free plan free forever and actually make it even better than it is today. I think, given the economies of scale, it seems like it&#8217;s going to be possible for us to do that. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: If you had the opportunity to give one piece of advice to another company that was debating whether or not to adopt a similar model and go-to-market it in a similar way, what would your number one piece of advice be?</b></p>
<p><b>Marc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to your users, and truly build a product that is satisfying and fulfilling a deep need for your users. Freemium might be a good option, but it also might not be. The reality is you need to actually speak to your users, find out what the use cases are and find out why they are using the product. </span></p>
<p><b>Eleni: Thanks so much for chatting with us today. Where can people find you if they want to connect? </b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the latest episode of <strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/product-to-product-podcast" target="_blank">Product to Product</a></strong>, a podcast for / by product people.</p>
<p>Listen to the episode below:</p>

<p>We’re joined by <strong><a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com/" target="_blank">Ellen Chisa</a></strong>. You may know her as the VP of Product at <strong><a href="https://www.lola.com/" target="_blank">Lola</a></strong>, a former product manager at <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a></strong>, or as a previous PM at Microsoft. Most recently, Ellen left Lola to launch <strong><a href="http://ellenandpaulsnewstartup.com/" target="_blank">her own startup</a></strong> that will make it possible to build a complete scalable app in an afternoon. She&#8217;s essentially creating a brand new programming language that aims to bring the ability to write software to a billion people. While her startup is still in very early stages, Ellen is completely in founder mode.</p>
<p>Our CEO, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji/" target="_blank">Latif Nanji</a></strong>, has first-hand experience with the <strong>PM-to-startup founder journey</strong>. So we thought, who better to chat with Ellen about how a role in product can prepare you to be an early-stage startup founder? With an increasing number of PMs starting their own companies, the two entrepreneurial PMs discuss how you can apply your PM experience as an early-stage founder. Plus: they determine whether product is actually the right field to be in when starting your own company.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Latif: Thank you, Ellen, for coming to the podcast.</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for having me. I&#8217;m excited to get to talk about going from product to being a founder.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Perfect. I wanted to start by asking you if you could talk a little bit about your career in product management.</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. I&#8217;ve spent most of my career in product management.</span></p>
<p>I did my undergrad in engineering at a brand new engineering school that focused on project-based learning. From there, I worked at Microsoft, and then I was a product manager at Kickstarter in New York. And then, I was at an incubator and ended up becoming head of product for one of the projects, which was Lola, a travel company based out of Boston. I was there through our series B, and built out the product team. Then, last spring I left to start a company with my co-founder, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now.</p>
<p><b>Latif: I would love to hear a little bit about your new startup. What problem are you looking to tackle?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the things I&#8217;d worked on at Microsoft and at Kickstarter—and the thing that was missing for me in travel—was helping people make things. In particular, I really like helping people make software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My co-founder, Paul Baker, and I felt like it was still way too difficult to make software. We spent a lot of time doing logistical, operational tasks to get things done—not writing or shipping feature code. We wanted to go about removing as much of that complexity as possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: That sounds like a pretty big problem to tackle. I was reading your website—and it sounds like you’re looking to build a new programming language. Is that correct?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is, actually. We really felt like a big issue was that we&#8217;ve been incrementally improving our development tools, when in fact our environment has completely changed from writing code on one machine to writing code that needs to go to a distributive system. We felt like languages weren&#8217;t designed for that. We started building a language that&#8217;s really tightly integrated into its own editor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><hr /><p><em>"Now, at this startup, everything is my job"</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Now%2C%20at%20this%20startup%2C%20everything%20is%20my%20job%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3761' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
<p><b>Latif: How has that transition been from going to running a product team, to doing that </b><b><i>plus</i></b><b> being the CEO and founder of a company? </b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like in my last role I was doing a lot of founder-related things as well. I was definitely involved across the board, since I was there so early. But there was still a lot of stuff I didn&#8217;t have to do. I didn&#8217;t have to be a person who was doing the fundraising. I didn&#8217;t have to be the person who was figuring out where our office should be. I didn&#8217;t have to think about payroll and benefits, and hiring. I thought about hiring for just the product team and I helped do interviews, but it wasn&#8217;t as though I coordinated the entire process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, at this startup, everything is my job—and that leaves a lot less time for the type of product work I was doing before.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Are you still looking to hold product for the early part of the startup, or have you thought about how you would structure the first set of hires? And how does product management fit into that?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">My co-founder, Paul, started working on this before I did and he is really great at product. He&#8217;s really great at the long-term vision and looking at something and knowing if it&#8217;s done or if it&#8217;s good enough. But he didn&#8217;t have as much of the classical training for, &#8220;How do we get a process set up? How do we make sure we&#8217;re shipping the right things? How do we think through our hypotheses?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some degree, I can rely on him really heavily for early-stage product work—and both of us really like product work—so that&#8217;s sort of our unifying thing as founders. That&#8217;s been extremely helpful. We&#8217;ve also thought a lot about the person we want doing design at the startup. We want someone who is a very well-rounded designer, who&#8217;s excited about being involved throughout the whole process. Not someone who just wants to solve a constrained set of problems.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: What were some of the things in that last six months at Lola that pushed you to build your own startup </b><b>What prepared you to make the transition from a product manager to a founder?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always knew that I wanted to start something again. I&#8217;d done a startup with some friends in college. It was a complete disaster. I knew I wanted to do it again once I had enough experience to feel like I was doing it well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timing actually was completely unplanned and was very inconvenient. I planned to stay at Lola. I loved the team. I loved what we were building. But even so, when I went into Lola, I&#8217;d taken the role because I really wanted to work with Paul English, the CEO, because I really respected him as a founder. I went in planning to learn from him, and I told him upfront that this was something I really cared about doing, which is part of why he supported me in that journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think probably the biggest thing for me in that last six months was that my team started growing and having more experience, and I got pretty comfortable with letting other people make decisions. I think that&#8217;s a thing that a lot of early founders can struggle with because you feel like every decision is really important. You feel like you&#8217;re the one who has the final say, and you have to figure it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think having the experience of my team coming to me and saying, &#8220;Oh, I want to own this core part of the product&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, I want to differentiate our strategy for these two user groups&#8221; really helps me learn to let go. I think that&#8217;s helped a lot with the stress of being a founder.</span></p>
<p><strong>Latif: Was there anything personally that you were setting yourself up for? Was there anything tactical that you were reading? Were you starting to talk to investors early on? What kind of activities did you do on that front?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I got pretty lucky. I had actually started building relationships with investors—because I got to be involved in meetings at Lola and through events, conferences, and spending time in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent a lot of time writing and sharing my ideas before I became a founder, and I think that made me comfortable sharing things that I worked on publicly. It helped me think about, &#8220;How do I think about building a team? How do I think about hiring? How do I think about product?&#8221; It gave me a little more breadth than I would have had just from my role internally.</span></p>
<p>Then, the second piece of that—which I wish I would have done a little bit differently than I did—was since I was writing, a lot of product managers would reach out to me and want to grab a coffee, want to chat. I got to meet a lot of people, and I think that can be really helpful––to have people to bounce ideas off of. I do wish I would have diversified roles a little bit more. I feel like I know a billion PMs, and I wish I knew maybe a third of a billion PMs, a third of a billion engineers, and a third of a billion designers, instead of having it be so concentrated in one job description.</p>
<p><b>Latif: Wow. That actually is quite insightful, because then when you&#8217;re trying to hire for those people, it sounds like you have to build out those networks—which you are probably doing now, I suspect.</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The nice thing about knowing PMs is PMs do know lots of other people. I take meetings with everyone I know who is a PM and I ask them who some of the best people they&#8217;ve worked with are—people who they think this idea would resonate with. I get introductions, and then I continue those conversations. I think it would have helped to build some of those relationships earlier.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: How have some of the team structures you&#8217;ve seen in product management influenced your decisions on structuring your startup&#8217;s team?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I care very much about having democratized teams—a lot of autonomy in decision making. I think when I&#8217;ve seen product teams move slowly, it&#8217;s often because a founder or a head of product wants to make all of the decisions. They need everything to come through for approval and have a bunch of meetings before something gets decided. That&#8217;s frustrating for the PM who really does want to be able to develop their own ideas that fit into the company&#8217;s strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think a lot about, &#8220;How do we set up the right high-level guide rails so everyone on the team knows what we&#8217;re trying to do?&#8221; But not set up, &#8220;You have to do it this way&#8221; or &#8220;This is the right answer.&#8221; And instead, focus on helping people make sure they&#8217;re solving the right problems.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Do you feel like you have to spend a lot more time outside of the product because the type of problem you’re solving is very complex? How have you started to think about those problems as a founder?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things I feel that is most important for an early stage startup is having founders in the office frequently, and having founders who have their hands on the product all of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I&#8217;m taking on a large set of those other responsibilities because that gives Paul, my co-founder, the leeway to be in the office writing code pretty much continuously without being interrupted by meetings. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s very important to me—I just feel like part of my job is being there to help Paul do the work that he is best at, and be most successful.</span></p>
<p>I think, personally, it&#8217;s also a little more taxing for me to go meet new people every single day for however many meetings per day, compared to working with the same product every single day and coming into the office super excited to see these people. It’s not that I don&#8217;t like new people—there&#8217;s just a different feeling when you&#8217;re working with someone you work with every single day, and when you&#8217;re meeting someone brand new.</p>
<p><b>Latif: How are you planning to build out your team early on? Who are your first set of key hires are? Is a product manager going to be hired in the near future?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. We decided pretty early on what we wanted the core team to be—and that&#8217;s two engineers, one infrastructure scalability person, one designer, one operations manager to help with everything logistical, and then the two of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Paul and I are both drawn to product, having an additional person would remove us from what we&#8217;re both good at and like to do. I think also because the product is relatively ambitious, I think it would be difficult for that person to get their head around it at this stage, as compared to a little bit later on when we have some more pieces of the direction figured out.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Could you talk a little bit about what you most enjoy about switching over to a founder? And what have been some of the biggest benefits of that?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think one of the things I really like is that it feels like there&#8217;s no safety net. Whereas I feel like when you’re working in product you’re working with a founder, and you are trying to help them figure out where they&#8217;re going, and why, and get things done. But at the end of the day, you know that they&#8217;re not going to let you do something that&#8217;s completely wrong. You kind of have this extra gut check that goes into it, and it&#8217;s a gut check with authority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, I think that&#8217;s really helpful when you&#8217;re starting out, but I wanted to be in the position where I felt like I was going through that myself.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Have there been decisions where you felt like the gut check wasn&#8217;t completely valid, and you weren&#8217;t completely confident? How did you approach that problem? Did you talk to other product managers, other founders, advisors?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul and I do that together. We hired our first engineer, Ian Connelly—and just having another person in the room was really helpful, especially another person with fresh eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large part of that is talking about things as a team and taking a step back, and bringing our three independent opinions together—and Stephie&#8217;s as well, our operations manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it&#8217;s also about bringing external people in. We bring in people to usability test. Some of those people are the specific type of engineer who would use our product early on. Some of those are friends who have been engineers for a long time and we want to get their high-level thoughts on the direction. Some of those are other entrepreneurs. I think it&#8217;s just about bringing people in and making sure we have the right people to bounce ideas off of.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: How have you focused your time as a product manager? Are there any specific areas that you were maybe surprised by how much time they require?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I used to spend a lot more time helping people figure out what was going on, or kind of debugging their problems. I think it&#8217;s because I was in a slightly larger organization, so I would spend time talking to PMs about, &#8220;How do I convince this person of this thing? I&#8217;m having this problem. How can I make it go better.&#8221; In an early stage startup, there isn&#8217;t really any of that friction, and so I got back a lot of time from that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><hr /><p><em>"I used to spend a lot more time helping people figure out what was going on, or debugging"</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22I%20used%20to%20spend%20a%20lot%20more%20time%20helping%20people%20figure%20out%20what%20was%20going%20on%2C%20or%20debugging%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3761' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same thing, even as a head of product, I wanted to have one-on-ones with my peers on the executive team, with my manager, with my team, and so a large chunk of my week just went to having one-on-one meetings with people, and kind of keeping the train on the tracks. Whereas at a four-person company—which is what we are right now—there&#8217;s only so many meetings you need to have, and a lot of them happen ad hoc because we&#8217;re all sitting in one room together. We&#8217;re all building the same thing. We&#8217;re very tightly focused. I think to that regard, I got a lot of that time back, that I didn&#8217;t have before.</span></p>
<p><strong>Latif: I totally get that. One of the things I discovered is that I had to go back to the days of requirements, and doing excessive numbers of wireframes and mock-ups, and get better at design. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s something you ran into as well, as part of the startup.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A little bit. I think it&#8217;s a little bit better since we started from a language. Engineers really like designing languages, so some components of that are handled by my co-founder and our engineer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But yeah, there was definitely an adjustment period where I went back to doing work instead of managing people––and even just like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to set up our Trello.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t do that. We had someone who specifically was great at setting up task management systems at my last job, and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I like setting up Trello. I&#8217;ve done this a billion times. I just haven&#8217;t done it in the last year or two.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Can you talk a little bit about how you define success as a startup founder and as a product manager?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I have a framework that I use for myself, where what I’m looking at as a product manager changes depending on what the business goal is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me right now, metrics aren&#8217;t very important, because we haven&#8217;t shipped anything to users. We&#8217;re building things out incrementally, and so almost everything I look at is a combination of, &#8220;Where do we see the future going?&#8221; and &#8220;What is the future we want to build?&#8221; And then, &#8220;Are users using it? How do they react to it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s sort of a mix of what I think of as being almost an artistic vision, and also qualitative feedback from users. Certainly, metrics will come more into play as we get further along, but right now it would be relatively low numbers and not super useful for us.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Gotcha. It sounds like there is a larger qualitative aspect that&#8217;s going on where you&#8217;re evaluating how your users are interacting with the early versions of the product, and will probably continue to do so until there&#8217;s a point of confidence to ship it more publicly. Is that kind of how you&#8217;re thinking about the next few steps? What does that look like to you?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think of qualitative research as what helps you figure out why things are working or not working. I think early on, the “why” matters a lot more. The quantitative research is very good for figuring out &#8220;Is it working or not? What impact did this specific change have?&#8221; But right now, so many things change every single day that it would be hard to understand what the relative quantitative impacts of anything were, particularly at this scale. I think, later on, that&#8217;s much more important, where you can start to look at a set of things that you monitor over time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Latif: How has product management helped you become a stronger founder? What were those skills or traits that you picked up along the way that gave you an advantage over other founders?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think there&#8217;s a bunch. One is just comfort with having been in startups before. I know a lot of great founders who came from a different industry and found a problem that they really wanted to solve, but haven&#8217;t been in that experience of having this tiny team and just needing to get everything done—and haven&#8217;t been through the process of shipping software before. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s specific to being a product manager, so much as specific to having shipped software in small teams.</span></p>
<p>I think product-wise, another piece is I got the chance to work with two founders, Perry Chen at Kickstarter and Paul English who previously founded Kayak and then Lola. I had these examples of people who built great companies. What do they do? Why do they do it? How does the team respond to it? What things are beneficial or challenging for the team? I think that made me pretty aware of the dramatic impact founders have on a company, and I think that can be uncomfortable. A lot of people, especially in their first role that comes with some sort of power, don&#8217;t really want to own that. They just want to be part of the team, because that&#8217;s the fun part. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re a founder. You want to sit in a room and build things with these people, but I think it&#8217;s important to realize how seriously people are paying attention to your words and your actions—and so I think that helped a lot.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I&#8217;m also fairly lucky. One of the nice things about sitting in a product role is you get exposed to lots of things around the company. All of my roles have uniquely let me have a little bit of that. I also went to Harvard Business School, so I got a year of formal finance training, which was helpful. I think being in a seat where you can see lots of the different things that are happening means, even if you aren&#8217;t an expert in doing one of those, you&#8217;ve at least seen someone do it before—whether you thought they were doing it well or not––and you can call them up and ask them questions. I think just knowing what you don&#8217;t know, or knowing what the spaces are around you can be really helpful as a founder.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Now that you&#8217;ve experienced things from the founder side of things, how would you as a product person work differently with founders?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ellen:</strong> I started figuring this out while I was still doing product. There was a point at which I realized that a lot of my role was to help them express what they were trying to express, and get the team&#8217;s support and buy-in for that—more so than it was to convince them that I was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I had a lot, especially early on in product, tied up in wanting to be right, wanting to have great ideas. Towards the end, I definitely thought of my role much more as a facilitation role, rather than as a &#8220;deciding what we should do&#8221; role. I think that, again, depends on the founders and depends on the startup. That&#8217;s not necessarily how I want it to be here, but I think that&#8217;s definitely something where I would have tried to be more attuned to what founders needed in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think another thing is that when I first started working on an executive team, it was a pretty rough shift for me. As a PM, I was like, &#8220;Oh, no. PMs work cross-functionally.&#8221; Shifting into the executive team and now building our team, I&#8217;ve realized that it&#8217;s about a lot more than engineering, and all of the conversations I was having as a PM were actually pretty technical. I think I would have respected that the founder probably was thinking across a much broader space, and I would have tried to spend more time there, not just on solving specific technical problems.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: What do you mean by broader space? Is there a specific department that maybe he was thinking of? Was it resourcing across other areas of the business? What does that mean to you?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had never really thought about how different it is to hire and manage a service team, especially a service team that&#8217;s maybe compensated differently than an engineering team.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a mental model of how people work and why people take a job, and what they&#8217;re motivated by that was super engineering-, and design-, and product-focused. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about that class of problems before.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: What are a few tactical ways that a role in product prepared you to start something? What inspired you? What&#8217;s the mental preparation, if any?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve thought about this a lot recently and I&#8217;ll give you the backstory. When I met my co-founder I was happy in my job. My husband and I had just bought a house in Boston and it was not a good time for me to be doing a brand new startup. We were in the middle of planning our wedding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the risk profile is just such that I was like “Oh no I really want to build this company and I really need to do this.” I think I have a risk profile that is pretty well suited to being a founder, and I&#8217;m pretty good at seeing large opportunity rather than trying to minimize downside risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the truth for every product manager, and I don&#8217;t think risk profile necessarily correlates with product management. That&#8217;s sort of just a trait I&#8217;ve always had. I went to a brand new college that wasn&#8217;t accredited. I&#8217;ve worked at other startups. I&#8217;m just willing to kind of put myself out there. That&#8217;s a big thing that enabled me to be a founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One other thing I did as a PM, that I think was helpful for becoming a founder, was spending a lot of time with friends who are founders and that I really respected. I talked to them about the challenges they were going through at the early stage. For them, that was helpful because they had another product person thinking through their problems. For me, it was helpful because I was getting to see the other side of the table. And I did that with friends but then I also started doing it in angel investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve been in a product career for a while or you&#8217;ve built out a product team, you might be far enough along in your career that you might have the financial means to start writing small checks to other startups. I think that getting involved with startups is a good way to kind of see that side of the table, understand the problems that are going on, understand a little bit more of what you&#8217;re going to go through while fundraising.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would definitely encourage people—if you think you might want to start something eventually—to get into angel investing or advising other startups. It can be a good way to start to understand what you&#8217;re going to be facing.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif:</b> <b>Now that you&#8217;ve been on both sides of the table, what questions are you asking that maybe other traditional VC&#8217;s or investors wouldn&#8217;t ask?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m interested in hearing about how people plan to go to market. And why they decided to solve this problem. Which are more conventional things, but I&#8217;m also interested in how they’re setting up the product process. What was the last hard product decision they made? Why did they make it that way? How did they make it that way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m more likely to want to get a perspective on how people are operating, and a feel for what they like to do as founders, in addition to just is this the right market? Is this the right team? And I think that&#8217;s partially so I can learn and also because I&#8217;m looking for founders who are thoughtful about those things.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: There seems to be a whole bunch of debate around whether product managers are the CEO of their product. I was wondering, now that you&#8217;re in the founder seat, what is your opinion of this concept?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don&#8217;t feel like I think about product dramatically differently as a CEO than I did before—but I also think that my style of working is to do the thing I think needs to get done, regardless if it technically falls within my job description. Which means, honestly, that I&#8217;m not a good large company PM at all. I&#8217;m not great with authority. I&#8217;m not great with structure. I&#8217;m not great with rules. I like starting things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there probably are PMs who are like that, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re the PMs that every organization wants. I think an organization needs to be realistic about setting expectations around what they want the PM to do.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>For any product managers looking to found their own startup, what&#8217;s your one or two most actionable pieces of advice you&#8217;d offer so that they can prepare for that stage in their career?</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely start meeting and talking to other people—founders, engineers, designers, marketers, sales—whatever you think you&#8217;re going to have to hire early. And just start getting your ideas out there. If you don&#8217;t know what it is you want to start yet, just start talking about spaces that you find interesting. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re going to get to the point of starting something without some deliberate effort in that direction.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Is there anything specifically you listened for in those conversations that influenced your thinking?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I&#8217;m actually listening more to myself sometimes than to the other people—it&#8217;s what they say that gets me excited, what challenges my beliefs the most, and it&#8217;s sort of what starts to feel like “Yeah I really want to bite into this problem.”</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Just as a final question for you, where can people find you online?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;m </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ellenchisa"><b>@ellenchisa</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> basically everywhere but particularly on Twitter or for more background or more of my writing it&#8217;s </span><a href="https://ellenchisa.com/"><b>ellenchisa.com</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Latif: Thank you so much, Ellen for being on the podcast today, we really appreciate your insights and your time and we wish you the best of luck with your new startup.</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much for having me.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the latest episode of <a href="https://roadmunk.com/product-to-product-podcast" target="_blank"><strong>Product to Product</strong></a>, a podcast for / by product people.</span></p>
<p>Listen to the episode below:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This episode features <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanik" target="_blank">Aman Manik</a></strong>, a product manager at <strong><a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a></strong>. He’s been a part of Square’s product team since 2015 when Fastbite, the company he co-founded, was acquired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Aman was getting ramped up at Square, he noticed that the PMs he was working with all came from different backgrounds and had varying perspectives on what the role of a PM should be within an organization. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, he decided to get them all together to come up with a singular definition of what it means to be part of<em> their</em> product team. And they created what Aman calls a <strong>PM culture guide</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aman spoke to <strong><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nick-gray-51ab1267" target="_blank">Nick</a></strong>, our own product manager at Roadmunk, about the guide (the process of making it, how it’s used, the feedback it received, and how other teams can benefit from the same exercise.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The episode can be listened to above, and we’ve also included a transcript below.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Thank you so much, Aman, for joining us today. I&#8217;m really excited to have you on Product to Product. Before we get into this really cool idea around creating this product management culture guide, maybe you can describe to us what you define as product management culture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> I think culture is really interesting. The way I got introduced to a product management culture was at Box—where I felt like everybody I worked with was a friend. We were able to share the same values. We had the same passions. We were really about driving the business forward. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of hidden agendas or ulterior motives or politics that can be seen when you get to bigger companies.</p>
<p>But really, I think a great culture is one where—especially for product managers—you&#8217;re really sharing best practices with each other, you&#8217;re connecting around making each other better, and you&#8217;re ebbing and flowing around a common set of principles.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"I don’t think there’s a recipe to create a PM culture."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22I%20don%E2%80%99t%20think%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20recipe%20to%20create%20a%20PM%20culture.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3723' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>At Square, we all came from different backgrounds. We were product managers but we were all working on our own products. We were doing great in our own right, but there was an opportunity for us to connect a little bit deeper beyond being coworkers and friends, and really share what our expectations of product managers were.</p>
<p>Even you Nick, you came from a different background, so your idea of a product manager and how it fits at Roadmunk is probably very different than how a product manager fits in for me. So a really good culture is one where you can join on a common set of values and really build from there. I don’t think there’s a recipe to create a PM culture.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Yeah, I agree with you on so many levels. A great foundation when you&#8217;re in any organization, is trying to start out with camaraderie and friendship—getting to know people on a more personal level and seeing how those attractions lead into a more professional culture and environment. But as we go deeper into product management culture, how do you feel that lives independently from the company culture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> So, what I like about Square—and I think what keeps me there—is our passion for the small business owner. I feel like everything we do is about growing their business. And that’s macro and everyone has a common language and understanding. But when you get into product management, it’s separate because that’s more of a functional role. That’s getting one level deeper, about how do we actually get our products better, so we can serve our customers better.</p>
<p>Other roles like sales and customer support are there to help customers get started and solve issues—and it’s pretty standard across different companies. But when you talk about a product manager, in my experience, PMs all have their own general understanding of what a product manager does. It&#8217;s not a bad thing. It just means that everybody has their own shape and view of what a product manager does. And this is probably the reason why there are unlimited resources online for what a product manager does and how they can be successful, because there are very different ways a product manager can fit into a company.</p>
<p>The way I think about product management culture for us at Square, is that it&#8217;s really a union for us to share best practices and codify what a product manager is, in terms of their roles and responsibilities and day-to-day. Whereas, the culture for Square is more macro.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: I can definitely see the similarities when I interact with other PMs myself. Everyone does have a unique definition within their own organization. And it is a very fluid understanding of what a PM does. Was there a certain incident that sparked this interest to create a PM culture guide? Or were you inspired by another team that was doing something similar?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> So when I joined Square—I probably do this naturally as a human being—I tried to find places of familiarity. You know when you go into a building that’s dark, you’re always looking for the light switch; it’s something familiar. I came in and wondered are there other PMs at the company. How are their roles compared to mine?</p>
<p>What was really awesome at Square, we already had this product management ‘all hands,’ where all PMs would get together every month to talk about interesting topics and customer journeys. And I kept talking to PMs at the company, grabbing coffees, and having one-on-ones about the company. I found out that other PMs had very different understandings or views of how their role fits into the company.</p>
<p>The instance that was interesting to me was when I was getting ramped up at Square and I started getting my stride with one of my engineering managers. We were working really well. People were like, &#8220;Wow, you guys are really moving fast. You guys are beating milestones. What has been working really well for you?&#8221; And it’s funny, I took some advice from an older friend who’s happily married, about setting expectations in your relationship. So I thought to myself, fundamentally, the relationship cascades across everything, in my work as well.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"I came in and wondered are there other PMs at the company. How are their roles compared to mine?"</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22I%20came%20in%20and%20wondered%20are%20there%20other%20PMs%20at%20the%20company.%20How%20are%20their%20roles%20compared%20to%20mine%3F%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3723' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>So one thing I did differently with my engineering manager was go for a coffee when we first met and started working on a brand new project together. I asked him, “Let’s take the product management title out of the way. Let’s take the engineering manager title out of the way. We’re both partners here in trying to meet these goals. What are your expectations of me? Based on what we know about the project, where can I really excel and make our team’s lives easier, and make your life easier?&#8221; And he started doing the same thing back to me.</p>
<p>That exchange was really awesome. He pointed out that he really wanted me to shield the team from scope creep. He really wanted me to be the domain expert in what our customers wanted and help us prioritize. But even getting down to this is how we want to work together, this is how often we want to meet and this is the transparency we want to have when we speak.</p>
<p>So I shared that with a fellow PM and she thought that would be a really fun exercise for us all to do; to share our expectations of each other and our team. Because sometimes you feel like you&#8217;re doing exactly what a PM is supposed to do, but sometimes, I feel like I’m doing a lot of other things outside of that. It moves around; you wear multiple hats. So honestly, we made this process up and we pitched it to our head of product, and he said, “That sounds like a great idea!” So the other PM and I brainstormed how to do it and we ended up putting together a guide that we disseminated to the rest of the team to say this is what we think we should be doing. Here are some areas where we could improve.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: So before you even introduced this idea to your head of product, what were the steps you took to bring this guide to life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> In engineering, you have paired programming. So I asked a fellow colleague, &#8220;Hey, do you wanna pair on this?&#8221; We would then just sit down and brainstorm the best way to structure this.</p>
<p>We started to throw ideas around and so I thought, why don’t we get everyone to write down their ideas on Post-It notes. We didn’t want to bias anybody in the room; we wanted everyone to write down freely what they thought about their role. What are some important themes? Aspects of their role that they thought we should be doing or we shouldn&#8217;t be doing.</p>
<p>We put all these notes on a whiteboard. And then we started adding some structure to all these ideas. Once we got everything structured, we asked, &#8220;How do we turn this into something that’s readable and approachable? Our north star we can point to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I got together with my colleagues to share it with the head of product. He suggested the best thing we should do is rate ourselves on how well we’re doing in each of these categories. And that could be used to find areas of improvement for us as individuals and as a team. We coalesced our original idea with the head of product’s idea and began using the guide as an exercise in improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: When you were going through that sticky note phase of gathering feedback to build your culture guide was it limited to only product managers? Or was that open to other departments or members of the executive team?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> We made an explicit choice not to involve anybody else. And I think that was good idea, now looking back at the feedback we got. I think it was a fun exercise for us a group to do together, because everything we’ve done as PMs is always involving other parties. We’re always involving stakeholders in our meetings and thinking about the customers. So it was the first time where we wanted just PMs to figure things out internally. We also weren’t sure what was going to come out of this process. So we kept it to just us.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"How do we turn this into something readable &amp; approachable? Our north star we can point to."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22How%20do%20we%20turn%20this%20into%20something%20readable%20%26%20approachable%3F%20Our%20north%20star%20we%20can%20point%20to.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3723' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>We actually started extending our weekly product meeting by an hour to actually go through this exercise and add more Post-Its to the whiteboard. The intention was to eventually share this as an editable Google Doc to everyone else in the company. But we at least got the foundation out there, and then let the document evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: When you did share this with the wider company, what kind of feedback did you get from these other departments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> The thing that people loved the most was the empathy and insights aspect of the guide. One of the things that we all talked about was having better domain knowledge of our stakeholders, the customers, the customers’ “jobs to be done.” We thought, &#8220;Are we doing a good thing of gathering those &#8216;jobs&#8217; from our customers?&#8221; All of us felt we could always do more.</p>
<p>So when we put that as a big area in the guide of where we could improve—gather more empathy and insights from our customers whether it be our diners, couriers and restaurants—other departments wanted to piggyback on customer visits with us and jump on support calls as well. That was awesome, because it showed that people were interested in this, but no one had broken the seal, so to speak, of actually putting a concerted effort of doing it. Some of us already did that implicitly anyways, it was just now that we put it into a doc and formalized it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Let&#8217;s say that you had gone a different route during the sticky note phase and gathered outside feedback earlier. Do you feel like that would have had a negative effect on the PM guide?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> No, I think what that we could have created something together, but it would have been a lot more feedback for us to sift through. I think the exercise would have taken a lot longer. Imagine if we had added 10, 20 or 30 more people! I think it would have taken more of a village to organize and go through all the feedback.</p>
<p>It was really impactful to stay small and test it out because it&#8217;s a brand new process. Just like product management you don&#8217;t want to just say, &#8220;Alright here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re gonna do.&#8221; And do whatever you want. You start small. It&#8217;s one of our cornerstone values at Square, as well.</p>
<p>And starting small was great because I think we can revisit this again next year, because the role evolves over time, especially as we mature and grow as a company. Maybe next time we could even invite somebody from design over. Maybe we could invite one of our representatives from marketing—and not make it super large—but add a few more flavors. Or maybe even have an independent discussion with the marketing team and conduct it for them in relation to product development.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Did you notice that even after you had released this culture guide that it was received well? Was there any friction? Did you have to address anything immediately or maybe you completely missed something?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> It’s funny, I was hoping for some bad reception just because naturally everybody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Whoa, you guys created this yourselves. Did you put in my input?&#8221; But actually everybody was very supportive of it. I think it was a surprising delight. No one knew we were doing this. At one of our company “all hands,” one of our engineering managers said, &#8220;I&#8217;m very impressed and excited with our product management team. I feel like our team has a lot more structure now. I have a better understanding of where they&#8217;re coming from and what they want to do.”</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"You want to make sure that you control your time, not let your time control you."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22You%20want%20to%20make%20sure%20that%20you%20control%20your%20time%2C%20not%20let%20your%20time%20control%20you.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3723' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>I think everything was well received. I think people are anxious to see the progress. One thing that we&#8217;re going to do at the end of the year, or quarter, is we&#8217;re going to grade ourselves on how we did on our OKR&#8217;s and use that as a feedback loop to the guide. So that we can ask, “How was this guide helpful?” “Did it miss anything that we should be improving as a team?” “Are there other expectations we can include?” I’m really excited about that exercise coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: And has this guide been able to help onboard new product hires at Square?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> Absolutely! It has. We just hired two more designers and we hired a bunch more engineers—and it&#8217;s great. When we hire someone new, as part of their onboarding each person meets everybody on the product floor, every engineer, design. I used to just talk about what we do on product, sort of high level, based on my understanding and experience. But it&#8217;s so great that we put this guide together, because I actually have a structure I can go down.</p>
<p>Here’s how we want to drive the business forward. Here’s an example of how we did that, how we’re doing that and how we’re continuing to do that. Here&#8217;s how we do empathy and insights each month, and this is how we conduct that. It also lets me ask, whether it’s a designer or engineer, what are some of your expectations before I share what we do as PMs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: As I&#8217;ve gone into the product management community and spoken to other PMs, I&#8217;ve noticed there is one similarity that&#8217;s been flagged by people—and it’s that they feel the PM culture in many organizations is defined as the “shit umbrella” of the organization. I want to know your thoughts on that definition of a PM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> So I think this kind of applies generally for a lot of work, and especially for me. One thing that was kind of interesting was when looking back at my time as Fastbite as a startup, and then even looking back on my time at Square, I noticed the times I was most successful was when I was the most proactive. I think that definition comes in when everyday is reactive—like all the time, because everybody is just pulling you in different directions.</p>
<p>It is really tough and I think there&#8217;s no real strong way to give you a general answer here that can apply to anyone, but what I can say is take a look at all the shit that&#8217;s coming in onto your umbrella and see if you can identify some themes. I know it sucks because maybe you&#8217;re really tired and you’ve spent a lot of time. But what I found when you don&#8217;t put any time to plan a structure, the chaos ends up just building and forming. It kind of takes a mind of it&#8217;s own, right?</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"It is really important to know what’s expected of you and what’s expected of others."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22It%20is%20really%20important%20to%20know%20what%E2%80%99s%20expected%20of%20you%20and%20what%E2%80%99s%20expected%20of%20others.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3723' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>You want to make sure that you control your time, not let your time control you. I think it’s a feeling; it’s a symptom; it’s an emotion that we’re all going to have. I think a big part of this is taking a look at what that shit is and trying to really organize it a little bit. Let me get more context on where this stuff is coming from. Just the way you speak to your customers, you start talking to your stakeholders and your colleagues, and ask them in the same way, “Tell me more about the job I’m serving for you and where do I fall short?”</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Love it dude, it’s time to move away from the shit umbrella. How would you help facilitate other organizations to take the same steps that you did to implement this PM culture?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> I think what I would first do is create a guide for other teams of here’s how you conduct your own PM culture. And what I would do is sit down with the team, help facilitate and make sure they’re doing the right thing. Because I think it’s really easy to have a discussion and not put stuff on paper and not grade yourself. (It’s an awkward thing to do sometimes.)</p>
<p>So I would go in and create a step-by-step guide. Definitely, get buy-in that the team wants to do this. Because if they don’t want to, it’s going to be hard to get anything done. Once the buy-in is there, set up a time. Maybe it’s in the office, maybe it’s done outside the office.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Could you sum up why PMs in other organizations should do this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> It is really important to know what&#8217;s expected of you and what&#8217;s expected of others. And taking time on that with your team can help you build a culture and common fabric that you can grow from. Just as you may want to reflect on your year and what you’re doing the following year, it’s a great sort of PM reflection. I can&#8217;t see why this would not help improve any type of experience for a PM, their company or their team.</p>
<p><strong>Nick: Love it. I know that I&#8217;ll start looking into this myself and start getting the feedback loop going with our own PM culture here. So, I appreciate the learnings. Thank you so much for your time!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aman:</strong> Yep. Thank you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to our third episode of <strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/product-to-product-podcast" target="_blank">Product to Product</a>, </strong>a podcast for / by product people.</span></p>
<p>Listen to the episode below:</p>

<p>In this episode we have <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emichner" target="_blank">Evan Michner</a></strong>, Principal Product Manager at <strong><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></strong>—specifically for their chat tools, Stride and HipChat. Evan is one of those product managers who, as he describes it, stumbled into product. He went to school for creative writing and started his career in ad copywriting. After a few years of feeling meh about copywriting, he got invited to do “product-y stuff” for a new startup. Despite not fully understanding what that meant, he said, “Sure, why not?” and his career as a PM launched from there.</p>
<p>My colleague Eleni, who’s also a former-writer, was curious about Evan’s transition from writing flashy headlines to working in product at a massive tech company. But more specifically, <strong>how he applies his creative background and writing skills in his day-to-day at Atlassian</strong>.</p>
<p>With such a need for product managers to be ‘<strong>world-class communicators</strong>,&#8217; Eleni and Evan’s chat makes the case for why writing isn’t just a nice-to-have soft skill for PMs, but a necessary tool for them. Plus: Evan’s experiences offer some concrete ways for PMs to keep scratching any creative itches they may experience.</p>

<p><strong>Eleni: Hey Evan, thanks so much for doing this with us. I&#8217;m really looking forward to chatting with you today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> My pleasure—thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: One of the reasons I&#8217;m so much looking forward to this conversation is because I myself did the transition from being a writer into marketing—which I feel like is a very common transition. Going from writing into product, however, not so much. How did that happen? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> The more that I&#8217;ve been in product the more I&#8217;m realizing almost every product manager kind of falls into product management. You rarely learn about it in school or college or university. For me, I studied creative writing in college. Political rhetoric, poetry, fiction, all sorts of stuff and ended up my senior year kind of focusing on copywriting for advertising—which was not exactly in line with what my fellow creative writing majors were pursuing. I really felt like I enjoyed copywriting so I ended up working in ad agencies and focusing on headlines and body copy and how do you talk to people and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I ended up moving to Austin, was tapped on the shoulder and invited into a really small group when they were building a new business and they needed someone do &#8220;product-y stuff&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never done that I&#8217;m not sure how creative writing can apply to that, but I&#8217;m happy to give it a shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>So 10 or 12 years later, I guess it stuck. The fascinating part is I think it took me a while to figure out how creative writing actually helps you in product or marketing or any other field really. For a long time, I felt like it was unrelated and I&#8217;m just now realizing it&#8217;s very related. There&#8217;s a huge overlap.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: So when you were first introduced to product were you literally like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what this is, but I&#8217;ll give it a go?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah, literally! I sat down with one of the designers and this is one of those conversations that I&#8217;ll never forget because it was so pivotal for me in my career. I remember sitting down with the designer at the time saying, please tell me what the difference is between a graphic designer and a software developer.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: One thing I&#8217;m interested in, as someone who studied creative writing and has a creative background, people who choose to pursue that type of field usually have some kind of creative drive and desire to have creativity be part of their day-to-day. I&#8217;m wondering how product management scratches that creative itch for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Well, I actually go back to advertising, which is the first thing I thought I wanted to take a stab at, and being in advertising just for a short year or two, I realized this wasn&#8217;t actually as creative as I expected. I think my expectations were very different than reality. You know pitching clients, and getting deals, and doing all that stuff which is critical to the business of an ad agency, wasn&#8217;t quite what I expected.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"That creative process of how you tell a story, literally is product management."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22That%20creative%20process%20of%20how%20you%20tell%20a%20story%2C%20literally%20is%20product%20management.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3690' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>And at the same time, I will say that I also realized I wasn&#8217;t really going to be the best copywriter. I felt like I was okay at it but I could see other people&#8217;s work and I felt like I wasn&#8217;t great at flashy headlines or just really out of the box crazy stuff, which is part of the reason I was so open to trying something different.</p>
<p>I think before creativity, or maybe paired with creativity, is just the core concept of thinking. Like how you frame up a problem. When you&#8217;re writing a short story or a headline or something, you&#8217;re trying to think who would be reading this and why am I even doing this? Where do I want to end up? That creative process of how you tell a story, literally is product management. That&#8217;s literally what a product manager does is try to figure out how to get from A to B, tell a good story and understand who you&#8217;re talking to, selling to and solving problems for.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: A lot of the writing that product managers do might be in context that we don&#8217;t consider writing—like a Slack message or slide deck. You can consider that writing in a product context. I want to know from your perspective: what is writing for a product manager?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Everything. And I think writing is part of communication for a product manager. Because the other part is standing up and talking to the team. When you kick a project off, for instance, if you think about a product manager&#8217;s job you&#8217;ve figured out the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. You know the basic measures of success, you know how long you think you&#8217;re going to work on it until maybe you ship it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got some of the basics in place and it&#8217;s time to sit down with the team. And your whole goal is to show up as a product manager in that instant and make sure that you can look the team in the eye, communicate with them about what problem you&#8217;re trying to solve, why you&#8217;re trying to solve that, how it relates to the business, how it delivers the value back to the business and then how you&#8217;re going to succeed. What are you measuring here? And you&#8217;ve got all of that written out because people digest information differently. You want to be able to have that conversation with the team. Then you want the team to be able to go back later that day or that night as they&#8217;re thinking about it and reread everything you just said—maybe just slightly differently in written form. And they should be able to walk away with a clear understanding of what their purpose is. Over that next couple of days or months or whatever that is, as you work towards solving that problem.</p>
<p>When you think about how a product manager can fail they can fail a lot of different ways. But the one that seems to be the most common is just really simple things like communication. If a software developer can&#8217;t articulate why they&#8217;re working on what they&#8217;re working on, you figure out why. What information was lacking in that kickoff that you&#8217;ve reached a point where your team isn&#8217;t quite sure how they can chase the bug they&#8217;re fixing (for instance, on the most micro level)? As a product manager, you should be able to communicate the why behind things.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: So do you think developing writing as a skill is a bit of a stopgap against these moments of failure? Is it a protection thing?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Evan:</strong> Probably, to some extent. I think it&#8217;s also something you can exercise. You can get better at it. You can get feedback on it and ask your team. At Atlassian, we do something called health monitors. It&#8217;s not rocket science; it&#8217;s sit your team down and figure out what are we doing well at and what are we not doing well at. And often times what comes up in health monitors is we&#8217;re three weeks into this thing and I forgot why we&#8217;re doing it.</p>

<p>And you&#8217;re like that&#8217;s an easy problem to solve in the grand scheme of things. And often that comes back to I didn&#8217;t have the documentation, or it wasn&#8217;t clear, or I lost the page where we were tracking our success metrics. So as a product manager you&#8217;re thinking, how can we make sure to not do this again? I want a single page system your team&#8217;s using. I want a single place for someone to go and digest whatever problem we&#8217;re solving and why are we doing that really, really quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: Right. I&#8217;d love to get into some of these specifics. Can you tell me about maybe two or three concrete ways that you use writing in your role at Atlassian? Whether, it&#8217;s a document that you create or process you put in place. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> One example is we use OKRs. So objectives and key results. On the surface, it&#8217;s actually a really simple way to get a shared understanding around what are we supposed to be doing over the next quarter or two. If you&#8217;ve ever written an OKR, it&#8217;s some of the hardest writing you have to do, Because it&#8217;s constrained and very structured; it&#8217;s supposed to guide you and see around the corner to some extent, which is a really, really hard thing to do.</p>
<p>So when you think about all the different forms of writing from advertising and copywriting, to poetry, to political writing, writing an OKR is right at the top of hard things to do. Writing an objective for a team to understand and digest really quickly is hard. And then trying to crystallize simple metrics of success as key results is really, really hard. Because you&#8217;re maybe not sure if you can measure those things or what if this is the wrong thing? What if this is too broad or too narrow? And you need to fit it in a sentence or two; really short and succinct.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: So how do you make sure that it&#8217;s crystallized and clear and that your team will get what they need out of it?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Evan:</strong> I tend to personally treat it like a feature release. Where you&#8217;re going through dogfooding and maybe there&#8217;s an alpha and beta and then finally you start rolling it out to the world. That&#8217;s what I tend to do with writing. You have a small group of folks that you show and say, &#8220;Okay, does this make sense? Can you repeat this back to me? Would you know what to do if you read this?&#8221; So user testing to some extent.</p>

<p>And I will say that at Atlassian, in particular, we operate in a very, very open environment. You have people all over the world giving you feedback on whether this thing makes sense, or arguing through problems, or is this the right metric of success. If you can learn to harness that and use it for good, which almost everyone has here, it&#8217;s a fantastic weapon or tool to have in your tool belt because it is dogfooding software to some extent. Here&#8217;s this document or an OKR, do you understand what this means? And that takes five minutes. It&#8217;s not a huge investment and then you iterate through that and make sure it makes sense before you really sit down and go public so to speak with what your team is responsible for. What they&#8217;re signing up for, for the next two or three quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: Do you have a template that you follow for that OKR?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah, so we use templates for OKRs. We use templates for almost everything. We have something we call project poster here. And it&#8217;s a really basic, what problem are you solving? Why? How does this deliver value to the business? And how do you know if this is good or bad? How do you know if this succeeded?</p>
<p>So we use template for OKRs. We use templates for project posters. We have a whole playbook here at Atlassian that lets teams self-manage their way through problems from brainstorming to health monitors. All this kind of stuff, which is a blessing for a product manager. You have enough problems going on and just to pull out a play on aligning around a shared understanding. You know every couple weeks as you&#8217;re in this multi-month project for instance, how are we doing? Do we know what we&#8217;re doing? Has our goal changed? Just some communication tactics like that.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: It&#8217;s so funny how those questions that you think would be completely a given and known to everyone so often just really are not. Like what are we doing?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Evan:</strong> I agree and part of when you watch a product manager go through a project, feature or problem, what you can often forget is how long he or she has been thinking about that problem relative to the rest of the team. We take that for granted. How many times have you shown up as a product manager and sat down with a team and everyone&#8217;s ready to go and you leave the room and everyone goes, &#8220;Wait, what are we doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the product manager, you&#8217;ve been doing research and talking to users and lining up your documents and doing design and prototyping, while everyone else has been thinking about something else in some cases.</p>
<p><strong>Eleni: How does writing help product managers give people that context? Like taking it all the way back to the beginnings of their thought processes? Is that part of the role of writing for you?<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Evan:</strong> I believe it is and I would say, personally, writing it out helps me make sure that I&#8217;m thinking about it in the right way. It&#8217;s a self-test of does this actually make sense? It&#8217;s an elevator pitch, right? Can you write an elevator pitch for this yet? Can you repeat it back to someone in 15 seconds or less? And walk away with a basic understanding of what it is.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"What is that one sentence that can immediately create this magical shared understanding?"</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22What%20is%20that%20one%20sentence%20that%20can%20immediately%20create%20this%20magical%20shared%20understanding%3F%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3690' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>For me, just the fact of trying to sit down and articulate why you&#8217;re trying to solve this thing is the first step in making sure you&#8217;re actually solving the right thing. And second of all can you communicate that to the team? Can someone else digest this? Does this make sense? Is this the source of truth? Will we update this? Does the writing make sense? When you think about reading an article in a magazine you kind of have an introduction, <span class="s1">you have the middle, and you&#8217;re in the suspenseful middle part and then you end with this conclusion. Does your product document read like that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Right, that&#8217;s a really cool analogy. Do you think that a lot of product managers pay attention to writing and why or why not? Do a lot of product people think of this as a standalone skill that they need to develop or do you think it&#8217;s just not on product managers&#8217; radars?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> I think it depends. As you know product managers come from such a diverse number of backgrounds, which is the goal. It&#8217;s not let&#8217;s bring more people in who know how to write well or have degrees in liberal arts or even computer science. It&#8217;s when you mix all those various people together you end up, ideally, with a better problem, a clearly defined problem and a better solution ultimately for the business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In our case, I think that we end up probably spending maybe more time than most product teams on written communication, primarily because </span><span class="s1">A) we have a number of folks who have backgrounds in communications of some sort, but B) because our teams are all over the world. You can&#8217;t just depend on sitting down in the hallway and getting your story straight and off you go. So probably more so than the average team I think.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Since you mentioned your degree again, copywriting/creative writing is all about being creative and clever. I&#8217;m curious to know as you transition into product, how did you adapt your writing style to product management. But also, when you’re writing now on the job how does that creative and clever side come out? How is it advantageous to you now?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> I do a lot of presenting. Speaking out loud, whether that&#8217;s as small as a team kick-off or we have town halls. Learning to write for that actually has been another pretty fascinating exercise in constrained creativity to some extent. When you stand up and talk for 20 minutes, most folks are hardly going to remember much of it. As a speaker, you want to believe that they’re going to remember every single word that you wept over and put energy into. In reality, they probably don&#8217;t, which is the same as a written document or a blog post you write.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> As a product manager, you think about how can I make sure that if they read nothing else, if they can only walk away with one thing what is that one thing that I want everyone to understand. What is that one sentence that can immediately create this magical shared understanding? And build this compass for the team? I think there&#8217;s this really fascinating intersection with public speaking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: How do you get people to remember that one thing?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Well, one tactic is saying it over and over again until you’re sick of it yourself maybe. Often when you think about why you would ask that question, it&#8217;s either because we didn&#8217;t say it enough times or maybe you need to say it in a different way? When you think about just any communication you have today, just mirroring back. &#8220;What I heard you say is this? Is that right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Just basic mirroring back and repeating. Maybe using different words. When you think about a team or even just a triad—a product manager, a designer and an engineer—at the core of what a team is for the most part (and that&#8217;s before you even start layering in the marketing and press and support everyone else), every one of those people receive information differently. There are people there who really need just written.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: That&#8217;s a really interesting point. Can you break that down for us a little bit more? How do you write specifically, but communication more broadly to those different departments like marketing, engineering, sales? Just explain to us the different approaches you take to each of the key departments that you work with?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;ll give you a couple of examples. The first one is when you think about just the core, basic writing is a requirement, whether it&#8217;s a document or Jira tickets or whatever that is for a product manager. Typically the vision you have in your head is: product manager comes up with thing, tells team, product manager sits down, writes stories, requirements, team does those things. In reality that may be one way to do it.</span>It&#8217;s probably not the healthiest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="p1">So one of the things we adopted on our team is co-authoring those stories. That&#8217;s really speaking to the strength and diversity of a team. The product manager, designer, engineer, each one is looking at that problem through a different lens and that&#8217;s a good thing. I think for a long time, product managers wanted it to be, &#8220;I&#8217;ll handle the requirements, but you write code or the prototypes or the mock ups.&#8221; That&#8217;s not a very efficient or healthy way to do anything and often times, the team probably doesn&#8217;t want to work with you anymore because they don&#8217;t feel like they’re part of the problem.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> One of the exercises we&#8217;ve adopted is co-authoring stories. For instance, that kick-off that we talked about, product managers showing up with what we call a project poster, which is at its core, &#8220;What problem are you solving? Why are you doing it and how do you know if you succeed?&#8221; And what happens is the team evolves towards the actual solution together, which is A) much healthier and B) </span><span class="s1">requires that you have designers and developers and marketers and support people, who are holistically thinking about the same problem, which means bringing in everyone earlier. Everyone&#8217;s willing to do that more well-rounded problem-solving, rather than just sitting down and banging out mock ups or something like that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: You work on communication apps. What have you learned from your own users about what makes good communication and good written communication?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> I&#8217;ve been working on communication-related products here at Atlassian for a little over three and a half years. The one theme that&#8217;s really started to emerge for me is we talk a lot. We end up writing a lot of words to the point where you think, &#8220;Did we do this before we had these tools?&#8221; I don&#8217;t see people getting distracted all day in the hallway talking about the football game, but for some reason we feel like that&#8217;s okay to do in chat, for instance. </span></p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ve taken that idea and said, &#8220;You can apply it.&#8221; There&#8217;s a lot of different applications. One to product management. One to just how we develop tools and products. But the key theme for me is talk in and of itself doesn&#8217;t really solve problems. It&#8217;s not actual work. It&#8217;s not helping you actually solve that thing. It could be an input to that solution, but it&#8217;s not actually doing anything until you say, &#8220;We have a decision,&#8221; or we have some sort of output out of this conversation and the team can take that away and actually do it.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Chat is a great example when you think about a team working on a problem. In a month or two into this project and everyone feels like it&#8217;s going well. Chat does a number of things like being able to let team members communicate quickly. You can imagine trying to write an email for every technical problem you run into. You&#8217;d never get anything done, so it&#8217;s fantastic in that regard. Some of the best teams have figured out how to harness that volume of conversation for good. They understand how much you really want to put into that tool to get something out of it.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><hr /><p><em>"Bad writing for product managers could be overly prescriptive."</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Bad%20writing%20for%20product%20managers%20could%20be%20overly%20prescriptive.%22&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3690' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Ultimately as a company, that&#8217;s one of our main takeaways. People need more than conversations. They need a decision or they need to be able to track this work or move out of this into the thing that you’re actually there to do. That&#8217;s where your work is. As a product manager, you can apply that in the same regard. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: I feel this ties back to what you were talking about before about concise creativity. Yes, you chat in volume all day long, but when it comes down to it, there is something to concision through fostering alignment with your team and making projects move forward.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Good writing for product managers is obviously different than what it would be for a journalist or a novelist or an advertiser. What are the ingredients of good writing for a product manager? What would be bad writing for a product manager?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Well, first I think it&#8217;s making sure that you actually know what you’re writing about. Maybe that goes without saying, but it&#8217;s amazing the number of documents or user stories, where you get into it and you go, &#8220;What am I doing here? Why are we doing this again? I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m communicating this well.&#8221; Go through that effort and exercise first to make sure that whatever that artifact is that you’re writing will make sense. Like I said, I do that in iterations, rolling it through dog-fooding and A/B testing and making sure someone can repeat it back to me the way that I hear it in my head.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: What about bad writing? What&#8217;s a no-no for a product manager?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Going back to that project poster, project-kickoff moment in time, bad writing is we&#8217;re building a solution with React. Thanks, you&#8217;ve completely missed the overarching problem and you&#8217;ve told the people who know far much more than you do typically, what technology we&#8217;re using. Bad writing for product managers could be overly prescriptive. We’re edging towards prematurely architecting the solution when you need the team to help you do that. You need to do that together. That&#8217;s probably maybe the most egregious example, is overly prescriptive solution-oriented writing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: A lot of product managers have the opposite background to you. They start super technical and then they move into product. What&#8217;s your number one tip for someone in that situation for how they can develop their writing skills?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Well, I would try and make it a project. Set an OKR for yourself, for instance. My objective is to become a better writer by the end of the calendar year, whatever that is. (That&#8217;s probably a poorly written goal or objective.) I want my team to be able to feel like they have clear direction. Maybe that&#8217;s the objective and your key results is maybe it&#8217;s you asking your team at the end of the year, &#8220;Do you feel like my writing has improved? Do you feel you could walk away with a clear understanding of where we&#8217;re going? Could you do your work better and faster?&#8221; That&#8217;s a lot of what I do is walk around and talk to our teams and say, &#8220;Do you know what you’re doing and why?&#8221; So that could be a key result, for instance. Write an OKR for yourself, make it a goal. If you don&#8217;t write it down it may not happen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eleni: Evan, thanks so much for chatting with us. This was really fun! </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Evan:</strong> Thank you so much for having me—appreciate it!</span></p>
