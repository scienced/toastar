				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any half-decent marketing is essentially storytelling. As a marketer, everything you create needs to tell the story of your product and the value it offers your users. That‚Äôs why roadmaps are such a natural fit for marketing teams. A marketing roadmap <em><strong>tells the story</strong></em> of your marketing strategy.</p>
<p>As leader of the marketing team here at Roadmunk, I leverage a few iterations of my roadmap to communicate our team‚Äôs initiatives across our entire company. We obviously use a ton of tactical software, but I go back to my marketing roadmap every week to regroup on the big picture. More concretely, I use it in a few different contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I present our roadmap at our <strong>monthly town hall meetings</strong>, where our whole company can align on what our marketing team has in the pipe.</li>
<li>I show different pivots during <strong>strat alignment sessions</strong> to get buy-in from our executive team.</li>
<li>I use project-specific roadmaps to plan <strong>feature releases</strong> or <strong>big initiative launches</strong>.</li>
<li>I also use our roadmapping tool for <strong>lightweight resource planning</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought it would be cool to give a window into my process and how I use different versions of my roadmap. For this exercise, I‚Äôm using our <strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/marketing-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">marketing roadmap template</a></strong>, which is accessible within Roadmunk. (And as a side note for non-marketers, we also have a wide selection of <strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">roadmap templates</a></strong> that you can check out in-app or on our website.)</p>
<p>K, let‚Äôs go. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f4a8.png" alt="üí®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f6b2.png" alt="üö≤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h1>The theme-based marketing roadmap</h1>
<p>This is how I actually structure the roadmap I show in our town hall meetings. After trying a few variations, I decided that organizing quarterly by theme was clearest. Here‚Äôs why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing by category was <strong>dead simple</strong> for everyone to understand. Even if you‚Äôre not a marketer, everyone knows who does digital marketing, who does content, who does design. It‚Äôs a crystal-clear way to orient the whole company to the activities of different members of our marketing team.</li>
<li>I tried a monthly roadmap, but it was just too constricting (and unrealistic) for our growing team at a growing company. Going quarterly gave us leeway for bigger projects, while offering some structure around time.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3358" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-theme-based.png" alt="Marketing roadmap - Theme-based example" width="1747" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-theme-based.png 1747w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-theme-based-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-theme-based-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-theme-based-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1747px) 100vw, 1747px" /></p>
<h1>The goal-based marketing roadmap</h1>
<p>When I‚Äôm doing strategy alignment with other leaders in our organization, I usually start by showing my category roadmap and explaining, ‚Äú<strong>This is what we‚Äôre going to do.</strong>‚Äù Then I switch over to my goal-oriented roadmap and show, ‚Äú<strong>This will be the impact of each of those projects.</strong>‚Äù</p>
<p>Our team evaluates success across a few different metrics, including <strong>generating qualified leads</strong>, <strong>building awareness</strong> for our company, and supporting sales to <strong>convert free trial users to customers</strong>. The goal-oriented marketing roadmap shows how you‚Äôre going to distribute resources to accomplish different types of goals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3360" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-goal-based.png" alt="Marketing roadmap - Goal-based example" width="1748" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-goal-based.png 1748w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-goal-based-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-goal-based-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-goal-based-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px" /></p>
<p>Using Roadmunk, it‚Äôs really easy to maintain two views that you can switch between in meetings. This is a screenshot of my actual &#8216;<a href="http://support.roadmunk.com/creating-and-working-with-views" target="_blank">Views</a>&#8216; drop-down for my marketing roadmap inside Roadmunk. Each view pulls from the same data set. It‚Äôs the same data, just structured differently‚Äîso maintaining each view is not finicky. During meetings, I‚Äôll often pivot between different views to give the full picture of our marketing activities.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3337 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmaps_views.png" alt="Marketing roadmaps - Views drop-down list" width="544" height="177" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmaps_views.png 544w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmaps_views-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></p>
<h1>The ‚Äúwe got deadlines‚Äù marketing roadmap</h1>
<p>Timeline is not my go-to marketing roadmap, but I do find it helpful (slash, sanity-saving??) when we‚Äôre rallying to a deadline with a particular date stamp. When we released <a href="https://roadmunk.com/new-roadmunk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">the</a><a href="https://roadmunk.com/new-roadmunk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank"> ne</a><a href="https://roadmunk.com/new-roadmunk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">w</a><a href="https://roadmunk.com/new-roadmunk?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank"> Roadmunk</a>, I plotted every single element of the launch plan on a timeline roadmap, so we could make sure we‚Äôd resource correctly to complete each step before launch.</p>
<p>The marketing roadmap example below (from our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/marketing-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">marketing template</a>) is probably more typical for <strong>process-driven teams</strong> <strong>that work on timelines</strong>. It shows a variety of marketing initiatives evolving over time, with projects assigned to particular team members. This is especially useful for <strong>teams that work with long (but strict) lead times</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3361" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-timeline.png" alt="Marketing roadmap - Timeline example" width="1747" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-timeline.png 1747w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-timeline-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-timeline-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-timeline-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1747px) 100vw, 1747px" /></p>
<h1>The ‚Äúwho‚Äôs doing what‚Äù marketing roadmap</h1>
<p>You may have noticed the ‚Äúby person‚Äù view in the screenshot of my views tab above. When I‚Äôm doing quarterly planning, I‚Äôll usually create a person-by-person breakdown of my roadmap. This <strong>ensures¬†we have the resources to execute on our projects</strong>‚Äîand make sure no one is going to be wayyy over-burdened. This is also how I <strong>validate new hires</strong>: determining which projects will make the biggest impact towards hitting our goals, then visualizing what resources we need to get there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3362" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-person.png" alt="Marketing roadmap - Person view example" width="1748" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-person.png 1748w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-person-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-person-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marketing-roadmap-person-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px" /></p>
<p>In a case like this, I can quickly see that Jamie doesn‚Äôt have much in her pipe. Meanwhile, Carly might be maxed out. Resourcing isn‚Äôt my primary purpose for building a roadmap, but it&#8217;s an easy way to get a snapshot of what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>These examples show the four key ways I currently build my marketing roadmap. If you‚Äôre curious to try it for yourself, check out our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=marketingroadmap" target="_blank">roadmap template library</a>¬†to get started.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roadmapping isn‚Äôt an exercise reserved solely for product teams‚Äîor rather, it shouldn‚Äôt be. <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">Roadmaps are communication tools</a> and are perfect vehicles for teams of all kinds to <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/get-buy-in-for-your-product-roadmap-from-each-department/" target="_blank">share their priorities and goals with the rest of the organization</a>.</p>
<p>To help you out, we created <strong>seven templates</strong> that can be used across your organization to boost visibility into high-level business strategy and more tactical team-based goals.</p>
<h1>1. The product roadmap</h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3221 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-product_tl.png" alt="7 roadmap templates - Product roadmap timeline" width="1747" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-product_tl.png 1747w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-product_tl-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-product_tl-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-product_tl-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1747px) 100vw, 1747px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs start with the bread and butter of roadmaps: <strong>product</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For product-driven companies‚Äîbe it B2B¬†SaaS shops or consumer-facing apps‚Äîa product roadmap is essential to organizational alignment. A product roadmap illustrates <strong>high-level product strategy and demonstrates how a product will evolve over time</strong>. It includes upcoming features and the nitty gritty of product development‚Äîlike technical considerations and resourcing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A product roadmap is a powerful communication tool that product managers use to align different departments on one vision. <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-sales/" target="_blank">It empowers the sales team to lead informed product conversations with prospects</a>, the marketing team to plan campaigns that align with feature releases and HR to determine who to hire and when.</span></p>

Some product teams love key dates, while others prefer an agile approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For deadline-sticklers, our template‚Äôs timeline view charts how your product will grow and evolve over time. You can organize your team‚Äôs tasks into pre-set buckets‚Äîincluding new features, infrastructure and stickiness. You can also highlight important events, like a feature release, with milestones.</span></p>

<h1>2. The strategic roadmap</h1>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3223 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-strategic_tl.png" alt="7 roadmap templates - Strategic roadmap timeline" width="1748" height="1079" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-strategic_tl.png 1748w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-strategic_tl-300x185.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-strategic_tl-768x474.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_templates-strategic_tl-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1748px) 100vw, 1748px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strategic roadmap is used to <strong>communicate an organization‚Äôs vision and mission</strong>, illustrating the key steps required to bring these two things to fruition. This roadmap is accessible to every employee, and it helps ensure that every department is ideating and working on initiatives that serve the organization&#8217;s bigger strategic aims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular roadmap is created and championed by <strong>senior-level stakeholders</strong>. Business objectives are generally mapped out across the long-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike a product roadmap that outlines what plans need to be executed in the short-term, <strong>a strategic roadmap is all about the long game</strong>. An organization‚Äôs vision and mission are often hefty, audacious goals that can be broken down into smaller, bite-size initiatives across many years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/strategic-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmaptemplates-strategic" target="_blank"><strong>strategic roadmap template</strong></a> includes a timeline view. Use this view to track your key strategic initiatives and milestones over upcoming months, quarters and years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovation roadmap is a great companion to the strategic roadmap. A roadmap can and should be used to <strong>map new areas for growth opportunities, testing new ideas, tracking competitors and keeping up with advancing technologies</strong>. Organizations only remain competitive within their markets when they continuously look forward to discover new business models and ways to bolster their products with value-added improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovation roadmap is generally built and managed by an organization‚Äôs product managers and its executives to align all departments on strategic initiatives. They help companies <strong>achieve disruption and avoid getting disrupted themselves</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track innovative achievements, like shipped features, against the work that your team is doing to keep sharp‚Äîlike competitive benchmarking and breaking down barriers preventing new and exciting things from shipping.</span></p>

<h1>4. The marketing roadmap</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing teams are generally project-oriented, and it‚Äôs very common for marketing teams to be slammed with multiple deliverables and initiatives at once. It gets hectic and unmanageable if not documented. Enter the marketing roadmap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing roadmap highlights <strong>key projects and priorities across all marketing channels and functions</strong>, creating clarity in the chaos. It charts all priorities and initiatives across all channels that marketing is responsible for‚Äîsuch as content, digital advertising and events. Creating an in-depth marketing roadmap surfaces a team‚Äôs highest priorities and keeps all of its marketers on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an added bonus, a marketing roadmap also serves as a key communication tool for marketing teams to share their plans across their whole organization.</span></p>
<p>Our <b><a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/marketing-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmaptemplates-marketing" target="_blank">marketing roadmap template</a>¬†</b>comes with two types of views baked in.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An HR roadmap is owned by an organization‚Äôs recruiters and human resources team to <strong>build and manage hiring plans and chart HR initiatives</strong>.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It visualizes how each department within an organization will evolve and provides a snapshot of the roles being added and when. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of roadmap is extremely helpful for <strong>catching gaps in talent</strong>,¬†<strong>ensuring that your organization is adequately resourced</strong> and that <strong>growth is properly balanced across departments</strong>. Each department leader can also use this roadmap to flag what resources they need and identify when their team will burst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This roadmap also provides insight into what HR is working on to make employees happier in their day-to-day like changes to benefits plan, new referral bonuses, etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A technology roadmap outlines <strong>how an organization plans to use technology to achieve their goals</strong>. It can be used in a couple of different ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some organizations employ a technology roadmap to <strong>monitor¬†technology considerations and resources</strong> within their product‚Äôs research and development strategy. Other organizations use a technology roadmap to <strong>visualize the administration of internal processes and systems</strong>, like information security audits and tracking¬†employee hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, a technology roadmap communicates complex initiatives within an easy-to-follow, actionable plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/technology-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmaptemplates-tech" target="_blank"><strong>technology roadmap template</strong></a>‚Äôs timeline view enables you to simply visualize timing for all technology initiatives coming up in your pipeline.</span></p>

<h1>7. The project roadmap</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A project roadmap can be used by <strong>various departments across your organization</strong>‚Äîsales, customer success, admin, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs a roadmap that can be applied to a wide range of projects that involve multiple stakeholders and moving parts. It provides <strong>a high-level overview of a project‚Äôs objectives, initiatives and deliverables</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A project roadmap is different from a project plan. While a project plan tracks each and every tactical detail, a project roadmap instead provides an overview of the most important components and milestones (i.e. the big picture). It aligns teams on key milestones and keeps everyone on the right path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the timeline view of our <strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/project-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmaptemplates-project" target="_blank">project roadmap template</a></strong> to see key tasks and deadlines, and how your resources will be allocated over time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A roadmap should‚Äîand this is going to sound banal‚Äîbe pretty.</p>
<p><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">Roadmaps are communication tools</a>. We‚Äôve said before that a roadmap isn‚Äôt just for you. <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/roadmap-presentation/" target="_blank">They‚Äôre created and presented to get all stakeholders, executives and your entire team aligned on one strategy</a>. Projecting an ugly, hard-to-read roadmap onto a boardroom wall will obscure your strategy, muddle your objective to achieve buy-in and bottleneck your execution.</p>
<p>As a product designer at Roadmunk, roadmap design is always top of mind for me‚Äîand I have found it helpful to<strong> approach roadmaps as exercises in information design</strong>. An effective roadmap design hinges on the deliberate use of visual elements and copy to turn your vision into a consumable, actionable plan.</p>
<p>Below are some tips for creating a roadmap that is boardroom-worthy.</p>

<h1>Find a frame that fits your roadmap</h1>
<p>First step: <strong>step back and look at the big picture</strong>.</p>
<p>There are times when a roadmap requires a brain dump of ideas, or extensive detailing of items‚Äîand that&#8217;s okay. You need to work on the micro-level to ensure that the necessary content is there. But when it comes time to present your roadmap, take a moment and consider that the audience might be seeing your roadmap for the very first time.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment when pivoting your data.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Don%E2%80%99t%20be%20afraid%20to%20experiment%20when%20pivoting%20your%20data.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3046' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p>How much information are you trying to display? Are weekly projects uncomfortably crowded when you project the next 12 months? Are your year-long initiatives getting cut off when you&#8217;re only looking at next quarter?</p>
<p>This is the importance of the <strong>timescale</strong> on a roadmap. It sets the stage for your items and helps (or hinders) the strategy you&#8217;re presenting in the boardroom.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3096" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-timescale.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap with timescale" width="863" height="405" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-timescale.png 863w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-timescale-300x141.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-timescale-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p>This could mean taking your annual roadmap with 100 weekly projects and presenting four separate timelines‚Äîone for each quarter. <strong>Breaking it down into digestible pieces</strong> will help deliver a clear picture of how progress will shake out in smaller chunks of time. (<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmapdesign-timescale" target="_blank">Try a template to create a roadmap with an appropriate timescale‚Äîlike the one above</a>!)</p>

<h1>Mark milestones</h1>
<p>Milestones pop out on a roadmap because they are treated with distinct symbols and colors. In design-speak, it&#8217;s called <strong>creating a visual hierarchy</strong>. When there are different levels of &#8216;stuff,&#8217; the audience is able to scan through quicker and discern the important bits.</p>
<p>In other words, milestones play well in the boardroom because it gives the audience something to anchor their attention to. (If you need some inspiration, you can always¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmapdesign-milestones" target="_blank">drop by our template library to build roadmaps with milestones</a>.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3100" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-milestones.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap with milestones" width="862" height="435" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-milestones.png 862w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-milestones-300x151.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-milestones-768x388.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></p>
<p>To maximize the impact milestones have, use them sparingly and with purpose. There are two useful functions milestones have on roadmaps.</p>
<p><strong>Internal milestones</strong> mark a significant event in the context of the roadmap activity, such as a launch or release of the product. This type of milestone is really an end-goal to a stretch of effort. Visually emphasizing these events adds a <strong>focal point to the roadmap</strong>. It gives reason and purpose to the activity and efforts that lead up to it.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>A roadmap uses color to make it attractive. A smart roadmap uses color to tell a story.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A%20roadmap%20uses%20color%20to%20make%20it%20attractive.%20A%20smart%20roadmap%20uses%20color%20to%20tell%20a%20story.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=3046' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><strong>External milestones</strong> mark significant events that aren&#8217;t a result of the activities on your roadmap, and maybe not even of your organization. They still have relevance and impact to your roadmap though (a big tradeshow or conference, for example). These types of milestones need visual distinction, but perhaps not as much emphasis. They are there to <strong>give context to the roadmap</strong>‚Äînot distract.</p>

<p>Roadmaps can get messy. There&#8217;s often a lot of things being fed into this one living document. But you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice if you don‚Äôt organize all of this data into <strong>manageable groups</strong>. You‚Äôll miss out on smaller narratives within the larger story.</p>
<p>Imagine roadmapping a company&#8217;s tactics for the first two quarters of the year. There are no hard dates yet‚Äîso instead, create six buckets (one for each month). The result will look like a series of monthly mile-long laundry lists.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3107" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_1-e1501621530298.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap by months" width="855" height="485" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_1-e1501621530298.png 855w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_1-e1501621530298-300x170.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_1-e1501621530298-768x436.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px" /></p>
<p>Imagine we <strong>pivot that roadmap on initiatives</strong>, i.e. creating subgroups for each month. The roadmap now instantly highlights that a team is focusing heavily on retention in Q1 and new features in Q2. These types of pivots make for much more compelling stories in a roadmap presentation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3108" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_2.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap pivoted on initiatives" width="867" height="498" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_2.png 867w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_2-300x172.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-pivot_2-768x441.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<p><strong>Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment when pivoting your data</strong>.¬†(If you‚Äôre roadmapping digitally, endless pivots are easy!) If you typically group items by product line, try grouping items by department. Maybe you‚Äôll catch some downtime or highlight stretches of stress‚Äîyou never know. (P.S.¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmapdesign-pivot" target="_blank">Use any of our roadmap templates to experiment with data pivoting</a>.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3065 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/roadmap_design_tips-colors.gif" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Colors divider" width="1668" height="272" /></p>
<h1>Harness the power of color</h1>
<p>A roadmap uses color to make it attractive. A smart roadmap uses color to tell a story.</p>
<p>The power of colour lies in its magical ability to <strong>convey relationships</strong>. A roadmap has a web of connections between items‚Äîmost of them unseen. Plotting them on a timeline or pivoting on a characteristic, reveals some of these relationships by proximity. (This is ordering or grouping items with meaning.) Color-coding items visualizes an additional layer of relationships. So be strategic with color: <strong>assign colors specific meanings that will help your strategy</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3102" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_status-e1501620287619.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap colored by status" width="854" height="482" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_status-e1501620287619.png 854w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_status-e1501620287619-300x169.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_status-e1501620287619-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p><strong>A common color assignment is by status</strong>. As seen above, even a simple three-color palette‚Äîred for backlog, yellow for in progress, and green for done‚Äîis enough to concisely convey progress and identify bottlenecks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_initiative-e1501620484796.png" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Roadmap colored by initiative" width="863" height="489" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_initiative-e1501620484796.png 863w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_initiative-e1501620484796-300x170.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/roadmap_design_tips-color_initiative-e1501620484796-768x435.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" /></p>
<p>Alternately, <strong>coloring by initiative</strong> can surface an important axis of your strategy. A timeline pivoted on department, neatly grouping items for each team, can show your audience that in the above case your strategy&#8217;s key component¬†is integrations, thanks to the prominence of blue-colored items across all departments. (By the way,¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=roadmapdesign-color" target="_blank">our template library can <em>also</em> help you create a similar color-coded roamdap for yourself</a>.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3066 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/roadmap_design_tips-labels.gif" alt="Design tips for your roadmap presentation - Labels divider" width="1143" height="192" /></p>
<h1>Scrub your labels clean</h1>
<p>Keep labels short and sweet! Word economy is important in roadmapping. It&#8217;ll help people read your roadmap quicker and not get stuck parsing out a sentence-long label trying to identify when that thing is. I like to think of it as practicing good label hygiene.</p>
<p>One way to scrub your labels clean is to embrace <strong>abbreviations</strong>. If your team repeats common words or phrases, consider adopting abbreviations that are easy for your audience to decipher. For example, ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù becomes ‚Äúmrk‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdev.‚Äù Roadmaps are a visual medium to showcase how your strategy is going to play out over time. <strong>Too much copy = clutter</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many opinions have been expressed (voiced rather strongly?) about agile roadmaps. We‚Äôve heard that </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agile and roadmapping don‚Äôt belong together</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are certain ways agile roadmaps </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">absolutely must look</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even that agile roadmaps are just plain confusing (partially why we offer <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/agile-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=agileproductmanagers">customizable agile roadmap templates</a>).

<p><b>What do you think of when I say agile product roadmap? Go!</b></p>
<p>I guess it would be like a theme-based roadmap. At a high-level, it‚Äôs a problem-based roadmap that outlines the central problem. It‚Äôs not a roadmap of features and building. It&#8217;s a direction of where you want to go, but being comfortable to iterate as you go.</p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs your approach to your agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p>Based on business goals and KPIs we define problems we want to solve for the quarter through discovery. From those discoveries comes a list of features to build or tests to try.</p>
<p>Throughout the quarter we evaluate and reconvene. We take a look on a weekly basis with the product team and a monthly basis with the leadership team and ask, ‚ÄúHey, do we even bother doing this?‚Äù That‚Äôs where the agile nature comes in.</p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs the biggest misconception around agile and roadmapping that you‚Äôve heard?</b></p>
<p>That timelines don‚Äôt exist. There‚Äôs always a timeline. There needs to be! You need some sort of frame of reference to say how much you‚Äôre willing to invest in this thing‚Äîat least in startups. The reality for most startups is you need to know when this is good enough; when do we move on to a different strategic initiative.</p>
<p><b>What do PMs need to know before creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p>KPIs. Definitely need to know why you‚Äôre doing it. What is the business impact and your goal for the quarter? You should also know what other teams‚Äô goals are. Make sure you‚Äôre not in conflict of one another.</p>
<p>Also, gather tons of feedback. Based on the goals and the areas of the business I want to impact, I‚Äôll talk to stakeholders and customers. Talking to your team is really important too‚Äîlike your designers and developers. They have great ideas too. Talking to people is the best thing you can do.</p>
<p><b>What is the biggest challenge when creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p>The biggest challenge I think is knowing the potential impact of what you release. You can have all the complex formulas and data scientists in the world helping you, but it‚Äôs an educated guess at best. Build small first and then build on top of that. It allows you to better predict what the impact is going to be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What do you imagine when I say agile product roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think of a loosely planned roadmap for the future of the product. Ideally it has an underlying structure and product principles the company wants to follow, but the exact items (and timing) have the flexibility to change. </span></p>
<p><b>Walk me through your own agile roadmap. How do you approach this process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m a visual person, so my roadmap has different swimlanes for each platform. It functions more as a peek into the product vision and where it‚Äôs going, so it doesn&#8217;t have dates or sizes attached to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we start planning for the next quarter, the appropriate roadmap items will move into a new document where engineering can size them. We&#8217;ll end up with an overarching &#8220;Q# List&#8221; of items that product and engineering commit to together. </span></p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs the biggest misconception you‚Äôve heard about agile roadmaps?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest misconception I hear is that the words &#8220;agile&#8221; and &#8220;roadmap&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t even go together. Working in agile doesn&#8217;t mean you no longer have to plan ahead. It just signifies a mindset that lets you change direction faster based on incoming feedback from the customers, the market, and so on. ¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><b>What does a PM need to know before starting an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agile roadmap should be directional, and not so detailed that it goes out of date as soon as you share it with people. Unplanned work will always pop up, and there will be projects that other departments need done too. In practice, adding dates to a roadmap often means you&#8217;ll have to update it anytime a date or scope changes. It can quickly become a burden. </span></p>
<p><b>What do you find is the biggest challenge when you‚Äôre creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to marry a vision for the future with the reality of time‚Äîwhile not having to update it every day. Roadmaps communicate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where a product is going </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing of features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level of effort required for features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How features are interconnected and more</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re likely overloading this one document and trying to fit too much detail in there, which then can become out-of-date. The roadmap tries to do so much, and is consumed by so many different stakeholders that every company&#8217;s roadmap is a little different based on their needs.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>When I say the term agile product roadmap, what comes to mind?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me an agile product roadmap is one where the actual timeline and ordering of things aren‚Äôt necessarily set in stone, but are oriented around customer responses and requests. An agile product roadmap is kind of done with the intention of change being planned into the process. </span></p>
<p><b>Tell me about your own agile roadmap. How does it look?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what we have is a timeline view of the product that gets broken down into a few different views. One view shows which internal scrum team is working on each feature and which client team adopts which features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a high-level, we always have a clear plan two quarters out, with a detailed release schedule over the next 12 weeks. And then we have a vision that goes at least two fiscal years out from today. We‚Äôre really just looking at one single, big roadmap with detailed deliverables and feature specs for one to two quarters. Everything that‚Äôs beyond is more aspirational.</span></p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs the biggest myth you‚Äôve heard about agile and roadmapping?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of people assume that agile means there‚Äôs not much planning involved. I would say there‚Äôs more planning and more communication involved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People think that roadmaps handle communication by themselves, and that‚Äôs not the case because you‚Äôre assuming everyone is monitoring your roadmap as closely as you might be. So you need to actively communicate any roadmap changes and track who might be affected. </span></p>
<p><b>What does a PM need to know before starting an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many ways to answer that! They should definitely know what the dependencies are for work to be completed. They should have a good sense of the estimates for the work that they‚Äôre committing to (for anything being delivered in the short-term). They should also really understand what their customers want or need, and in what order.</span></p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs your biggest challenge when creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the estimate fidelity and certainty of the schedule, because I know that tends to be the one thing in agile versus waterfall that is a difficult balance to strike. Also, having clear workback plans that give you the confidence that you‚Äôre going to actually meet the commitments that you‚Äôre making.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>When I say agile product roadmap, what do you think of?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately think of timelines and deliveries. Because to me an agile methodology is about getting a team together to continuously deliver in certain timelines. So I really just think of a timeline that can communicate back to my stakeholders within that timeframe.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me about your own agile roadmap. How do you approach it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My team‚Äôs approach is more of a hybrid. In order to communicate to my non-technical stakeholders, I need to break it down into swimlanes that are more simplified‚Äîand not so engineering focused. So we break up our swimlanes by themes that we‚Äôre targeting. These are like customer, marketing and product feature goals we have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We obviously don‚Äôt plan for a full year with agile, so when I put together my roadmap I think 120 days ahead. So tackling what we can deliver in four months and breaking that up by themes and overall goals for our customers. That‚Äôs how I break it up. </span></p>
<p><b>How do you plan for your agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôm really proud of our process over here. Our teams do the daily stand-ups of course. But we also do grooming sessions with just the product team and our technical product manager. (We‚Äôll also have our UX leads in the room.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really rely on those meetings to articulate my thoughts and problems to our leads. Before I can even make an investment, I need to see if it‚Äôs something our customers want. We do a lot of discovery before we ship to ensure our use cases are all understood by product. </span></p>
<p><b>What is the biggest obstacle when creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it comes down to setting expectations for your stakeholders outside of your engineering or UX teams. I know it‚Äôll always be challenging to evangelize what agile is to non-technical teams (there‚Äôs a knowledge gap), but it comes down to incorporating those other teams to understand agile processes. </span></p>
<p><b>Do you find having an agile roadmap there helps align those psychologies of time better?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it does. We do a few steps when we do our roadmap planning. We do high-level numbers and goals for our target months‚Äîthat 120 days. Which cycle will we hit this? This is what we‚Äôre aiming to do. So we set expectations early-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having that visual of the high-level of what we need to do sets that tone for the team so that they know what they want to complete‚Äîthe goals they want to achieve.</span></p>

<p><b>What do you think of when I say the term agile product roadmap?</b></p>
<p>Having your cake and eating it too. Everyone wants the speed of agile work but the predictive visibility of a roadmap. While agile on its own is great, I‚Äôve yet to see a larger company be comfortable running totally agile‚Äîso you definitely need to find middle ground.</p>
<p><b>Tell me about your own agile roadmap. How does it look?</b></p>
<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of hybrid approaches. I like roadmaps that use swimlanes to talk more about allocation to a problem than predicted results.</p>
<p>Sure, some major projects with set requirements end up more waterfall, but when you have a problem with no clear end goal, it‚Äôs useful to know how much time you can devote. Saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what we can do in two sprints‚Äù is way more accurate than, ‚ÄúIt will take us two sprints to get to x outcome.‚Äù</p>
<p><b>Do you think there are best practices in place for creating an agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p>I think there‚Äôs constantly a healthy tension about how much clarity you can create versus how much flexibility you need. On a perfect product team it should adapt. Sometimes becoming more predictable and sometimes giving more slack depending on the scope of the problem.</p>
<p><b>What‚Äôs the biggest myth you‚Äôve heard about agile roadmaps?</b></p>
<p>That you don‚Äôt need a roadmap if you‚Äôre agile! The larger your team gets and the more coordination you need across teams, the more important a roadmap becomes. Sure roadmaps are imperfect, but without them coordination is impossible.</p>
<p><b>How do you plan for your agile roadmap?</b></p>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot of background work in figuring out the priority and dependencies of initiatives. It‚Äôs unseen work, but it‚Äôs so critical. Digging into data and research; understanding how much time problems might take; coordinating and negotiating with stakeholders. If you don‚Äôt do this in advance, you won‚Äôt have the right roadmap. After this, it‚Äôs just a matter of making the pieces fit with your team‚Äôs resources.</p>
<p><b>What do you find is the biggest challenge when you‚Äôre creating a roadmap in agile?</b></p>
<p>Knowing that even the best laid plans go awry! Despite knowing in advance, it‚Äôs hard to be honest and reconcile when you don‚Äôt have the time you thought for that pet project.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behind every effective agile roadmap is a well-thought out plan. As true (and cheesy) as that statement is, it‚Äôs also a bit of a weird statement since a roadmap is meant to be <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">a (flexible and transparent) plan</a> that aligns stakeholders across your organization. So what we‚Äôre saying is <strong>you need to plan for your plan</strong>. A truly effective agile roadmap (i.e. plan) is one that people will have confidence executing. And without proper thought put into that plan, you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find individuals willing to stake their time, money and energy on your roadmap.</p>
<p>You might be asking: what‚Äôs the point in planning for an agile roadmap when <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/" target="_blank">it will ultimately change</a>? You‚Äôre not wrong‚Äîyour agile roadmap should be a <strong>statement of intent</strong> that you update frequently. But you should be updating your roadmap to reflect changes brought on by your agile environment, organization and market‚ÄîNOT because you poorly planned your roadmap. Prep work for your agile roadmap can prevent unnecessary changes and even complete overhauls of your plan.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2176 size-medium" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-4-300x87.png" alt="Agile roadmap planning divider - Planning tools" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-4-300x87.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-4.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>For all the PMs we‚Äôve spoken to, roadmap planning is a key step in their workflow‚Äîparticularly in agile. So before you open up your roadmapping tool (or app or whiteboard or spreadsheet *shudder*) to create your agile roadmap, here are <strong>five steps you should take for effective agile roadmap planning</strong>.</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Set your goals</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you‚Äôre creating an agile roadmap to </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/roadmap-presentation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate and align with all your stakeholders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are you trying to address? Even if you have a list of impressive features you want to release, <strong>the big picture must be considered</strong>. If you‚Äôre a smaller startup, your big picture could be achieving product-market fit. If you&#8217;re more established, the mission could be launching more¬†&#8220;sticky&#8221; features to keep customers coming back. Whatever the goal, your roadmap should convey to its audience that this is your plan for achieving your high-level strategy.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>Behind every effective agile roadmap is a well-thought out plan.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Behind%20every%20effective%20agile%20roadmap%20is%20a%20well-thought%20out%20plan.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2163' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without established objectives, expect stakeholders to walk away from your roadmap with different ideas of product priorities (basically the TOTAL opposite of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve with a roadmap). </span><b>Your roadmap should </b><b><i>always</i></b><b> tie directly back to your primary goals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that stakeholders are clear about your product strategy. When planning your document, ask yourself: does my agile roadmap speak to my¬†</span><b>company</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>product vision?</b></p>
<p><b>Bonus question: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reallyyy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific when planning your roadmap, also ask yourself what key performance indicators you want to focus on. Planning out your main KPIs will allow you to create a roadmap that explains how you‚Äôll hit those targets. ¬†¬†</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Evaluate your resources</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ten developers, but two are on vacation and one is being shared by the marketing team, how much can you ship in your next sprint? The answer: probably not as much as you could with a fully available team of ten developers. Planning for your agile roadmap should address your </span><b>available resources and their constraints</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Knowing what&#8217;s blocking your resources will let you create an agile roadmap that is honest about what can be achieved.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2184 size-medium" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider_1-300x141.png" alt="Agile roadmap planning divider - Man with paper and pens" width="300" height="141" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider_1-300x141.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider_1.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to plan: </span><b>the speed at which your resources operate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You‚Äôre always going to get pushback on how fast (or slow) your team is delivering on your plan‚Äîeven in agile. Plan what cycle length works best for your agile team‚Äî</span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/agile-roadmap-best-practices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially if you‚Äôre choosing to represent time on your roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even if you don‚Äôt visually represent your cycle lengths on your agile roadmap, determining your team‚Äôs speed will help you develop a plan grounded in reality.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Check-in with your users</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It boggles our minds when organizations build roadmaps solely based on quantitative data on their market. Your users‚Äô needs go much deeper than what statistical research portrays.</span><b> Speaking first-hand to customers during the planning phase of your roadmap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can give you insights into investments you never</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">would have thought of making. Before you commit to anything on your roadmap, it just makes sense to understand if your</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">users, you know, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want these things.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>Does my agile roadmap speak to my company and product vision?</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Does%20my%20agile%20roadmap%20speak%20to%20my%20company%20and%20product%20vision%3F&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2163' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, user research will help you make a really, really strong case when getting¬†buy-in. User research shows stakeholders that the agile roadmap you‚Äôre creating isn‚Äôt just a random, aimless plan you‚Äôve pulled out of thin air. It&#8217;s a plan developed from </span><b>authentic user needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">; something that will inspire confidence in the roadmap audience. It‚Äôs pretty hard to refute real user needs.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Determine your building blocks</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You‚Äôve established your goals. You know what‚Äôs blocking your team. You also understand¬†your users&#8217; wants. Next up: figure out the big initiatives and break them down. We‚Äôre talking </span><b>major themes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†to focus on and the </span><b>features</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fall under each of those themes. You can break it down further into </span><b>epics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>user stories</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just keep hacking away at the collected information until you have all the building blocks you need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting it onto your roadmap.</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2188 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-2-300x141.png" alt="Agile roadmap planning divider - Woman with laptop" width="300" height="141" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-2-300x141.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-2.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there you can develop </span><b>high-confidence estimates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the features, epics and stories you‚Äôll include on your roadmap. You can also identify any </span><b>dependencies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could potentially hold you back. If this seems like a lot of work to do¬†</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating an agile roadmap, we say to you: planning these elements will prepare you¬†to address (and defend) the choices you‚Äôve made when changes do pop up. And if you do need to make changes, you¬†can speak to the impacts and trade-offs that must be made to accommodate those alterations.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 5: Hold planning sessions</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step isn‚Äôt so much isolated, but more of an ongoing one that works in conjunction with the steps above. Chances are you‚Äôre not creating this roadmap by yourself (and if you are, geez, please ask for help!). </span><b>Make your agile roadmap planning a team effort</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by getting your whole product team into one room. This is your opportunity to really understand </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">together</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your use cases, your discovery work and your objectives before you make any investments to your roadmap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step gives everyone a good look at the plan you‚Äôve developed so far. Think of this as a way to get buy-in for the plan for your plan (again‚Äîstrange, we know). Early buy-in from your product team during your planning stage will be beneficial when getting </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/get-buy-in-for-your-product-roadmap-from-each-department/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">official </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy-in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and public affirmations from your stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2190 size-medium" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-3-300x141.png" alt="Agile roadmap planning divider - Man with tablet" width="300" height="141" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-3-300x141.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/agile_roadmap_planning-divider-3.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you missed our CEO Latif‚Äôs </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he debunked a common myth that product roadmaps are counterintuitive to agile. TL;DR: </span><b>Roadmaps actually fit quite nicely in agile</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since both roadmapping and agile are all about flexibility and transparency. (Plus, even the most agile teams can‚Äôt escape the concept of long-term planning‚Äîespecially as you scale.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latif also gave examples of¬†<strong>four powerful ways</strong> to visualize your agile roadmap (which you can find and customize in our¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/agile-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=agilebestpractices" target="_blank">template library</a>):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/#theme" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme-based roadmap</span></a></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/#fuzzytime" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fuzzy time roadmap</span></a></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile roadmaps can look many different ways, but¬†after talking to countless PMs, we&#8217;ve¬†found that most agile roadmaps fall into one of these¬†four buckets. And with any¬†type¬†of roadmap, there are certain standards <em>you just gotta follow</em>. Whether your agile roadmap comprises of swimlanes, fuzzy time buckets, or <em>really</em>¬†bright neon colors, here are some <strong>best practices</strong> (from us and a few product managers we‚Äôve chatted with) to keep in mind.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2052 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-1.png" alt="Agile roadmap best practices divider - Paper and pencil" width="751" height="181" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-1.png 751w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-1-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Treat an agile roadmap as a statement of intent</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúFrom just a mechanic standpoint, making sure that you have </span><b>a roadmap that can actually be updated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is really important,‚Äù says¬†</span><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ahsannanji" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahsan Nanji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Director of Product Management at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.ea.com/" target="_blank">Electronic Arts</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†(no relation to Latif). ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen PMs struggle with creating a plan that doesn‚Äôt actually build any flexibility into it. They map out these dependencies in a way that if they change one thing, they basically have to redo the entire roadmap‚Äîwhich is not great. So you want to‚Äîwith either the software or whatever process you‚Äôre using‚Äîbe very adaptable to change.‚Äù</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>Approach your roadmap‚Äîespecially in agile‚Äîas a living document that can (&amp; 100% will) change.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Approach%20your%20roadmap%E2%80%94especially%20in%20agile%E2%80%94as%20a%20living%20document%20that%20can%20%28%26%20100%25%20will%29%20change.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1968' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In agile environments, you‚Äôre frequently faced with change after change after change. If you‚Äôre too hung up on dates or details or milestones, you‚Äôre restricting your process significantly and ultimately setting yourself up for failure. Give yourself some breathing room when it comes to your roadmap, that way you can <strong>sync it nicely with the flexibility and changes you‚Äôll experience in your agile environment</strong>.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Determine if time is right for you </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This best practice is particularly important for agile roadmaps. When we spoke with </span><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/caseymck" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey McKinnon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vice President of Product at </span><a href="https://www.ecobee.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecobee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about his agile roadmap best practices, the very first thing he brought up was evaluating the role of time for your roadmap. </span></p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>Well, first of all I would consider if time‚Äôs a factor</strong>,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If the idea is that you need to hit a specific date and your product has to be at a certain level for launch, you need to compare that to something where you can put it out into the world and there are no consequences for when it‚Äôs launched.‚Äù</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some pure agile teams can brush off time constraints, while other teams cannot ignore the concept of time due to restrictions in the market. Other agile teams like to believe they‚Äôre functioning in pure agile, but as the organization scales and long-term planning needs arise, that &#8220;timeless&#8221; mentality starts to dissipate. <strong>All legitimate agile teams, all unique scenarios.</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"One of the worst things you can do is have everyone see the same roadmap" - @LatifNanji</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22One%20of%20the%20worst%20things%20you%20can%20do%20is%20have%20everyone%20see%20the%20same%20roadmap%22%20-%20%40LatifNanji&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1968' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So depending on your team, it‚Äôs critical to determine how time plays a role (if at all) in your day-to-day function. If it doesn‚Äôt play a role: awesome, your roadmap won‚Äôt incorporate any concept of time. If it does have a place, then you have to decide </span><b>how time will be represented on your roadmap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Maybe a <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/#agileish" target="_blank">timeline</a> is for you. Maybe you‚Äôre not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerned with dates, so you want to employ <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/#fuzzytime" target="_blank">fuzzy time buckets</a>. Or maybe you have a million <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/#sprint" target="_blank">sprints</a> you need to show on your roadmap. Whichever way you approach time, knowing whether it applies and its particular role in your environment will lead to a </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-roadmaps-counterintuitive-to-agile/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more effective agile roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Remember who‚Äôs seeing your agile roadmap and tailor to them</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a roadmap without an audience in mind is pretty useless. The whole point of a roadmap is to </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/roadmap-presentation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate and align with your stakeholders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the very first questions you should be asking is: </span><b>Who‚Äôs going to be seeing this?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engineers? C-level executives? Your customers? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYou want to really understand your audience first, because depending on who you‚Äôre speaking to, </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/get-buy-in-for-your-product-roadmap-from-each-department/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they‚Äôre going to want to see different things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,‚Äù says Latif. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre building this agile roadmap for engineers and very technical people you can get a lot more granular about information, whereas sales and marketing are more concerned about the ‚Äòwhat‚Äô and the ‚Äòwhen,‚Äô so that they can speak to your customers honestly.‚Äù ¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>"We use our test-and-learn culture to really find what investments we should make." - @spyo</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22We%20use%20our%20test-and-learn%20culture%20to%20really%20find%20what%20investments%20we%20should%20make.%22%20-%20%40spyo&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1968' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing your audiences means knowing what expectations to set; <strong>you know who you‚Äôre catering to</strong>. Imagine a mystery novelist showing up to a romance novel convention, expecting to sell out. It‚Äôs not going to happen. Romance novel fanatics are looking for very specific things (i.e. scandalous cover art and tales of unrequited love) that a mystery novelist (most likely) won‚Äôt offer. The same goes for your roadmap. If you‚Äôre expecting to get buy-in from C-level executives, but you‚Äôve created an agile roadmap specifically for developers, don‚Äôt expect a very productive meeting. ¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOne of the worst things you can do is have everyone see the same roadmap,‚Äù says Latif. If you know your various stakeholders each have individual goals and concerns, you can‚Äôt show up to each of these meetings with the same exact plan. Each one wants something different, so you must provide something that‚Äôs relevant to them. The result: </span><b>expectations are managed and stakeholders can feel assured that¬†their needs are being addressed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Know your product market. Like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">know it.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, this best practice might seem obvious. Of course, as a PM you should know your product market; you were hired for a reason! But we‚Äôre talking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> having a solid idea of what your users want </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you create your agile roadmap. </span><b>This means knowing what upcoming features your users want from your product</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, in agile this will change‚Äîand quickly. But having a strong understanding of the market needs will make your roadmap that much more adaptable to that inevitable change. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-pyo-b7380519/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Pyo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Product Manager at </span><a href="https://www.expedia.ca/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, puts it this way: ‚ÄúUnderstanding how your product works technically will help with your <strong>prioritization</strong>, because you‚Äôll know the different levers you need to pull to drive your product. What new, futuristic features can we push out there and at the same time what is the demand for that? What is the signal that we can get from that? We use our test-and-learn culture to really find what investments we should make.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other PMs recommend taking¬†a very user-centric method to collect market knowledge for your agile roadmap.¬†</span><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/rahuldkulkarn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rahul Kulkarni</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Product Manager at </span><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says, ‚ÄúI recommend getting out and validating low-fidelity mockups with customers as frequently as possible. Get real feedback, parse out what&#8217;s relevant and then come together with your team to say, ‚ÄòOkay, these are the constraints. We&#8217;ve validated and invalidated our assumptions with customers. Let‚Äôs do the next iteration of design.‚Äô&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are your market will be disrupted (and probably many times), and as a result, so will your roadmap. <strong>Keeping tabs on users‚Äô wants and needs will prepare you to be just as agile.</strong> When priorities change, you can update your roadmap swiftly to reflect any shifts in the market that you need to address.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2049 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-5.png" alt="Agile roadmap best practices divider - gears" width="751" height="181" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-5.png 751w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Agile_roadmap_best_practices-Divider-5-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Never leave your agile roadmap alone (and make it a team activity)</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be the easiest best practice to remember because it‚Äôs a natural outcome of working in agile. Since you‚Äôre working in short cycles, you‚Äôre immersed in a constant loop of feedback and reflection. You‚Äôre regularly forced to stop and ask yourself, ‚ÄúHmmm, so what worked and what didn‚Äôt work in this last cycle? What does this mean for future cycles?‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This introspective (and zen) behavior pushes you to </span><b>check-in with your roadmap much more often than expected</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äîwhich is really good! We&#8217;ve even suggested before that you perform a¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/the-10-minute-morning-routine-that-transformed-my-product-strategy/" target="_blank">daily check-in with your roadmap</a>, as it helps you¬†assess whether your plan is working for your stakeholders and company overall. Your document should always be up-to-date with your product strategy and if you‚Äôve created (and you should have) a living document that can change, it‚Äôll be easy to update to reflect the latest changes.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>An agile roadmap needs flexibility, constant attention &amp; frequent re-evaluation to be effective.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An%20agile%20roadmap%20needs%20flexibility%2C%20constant%20attention%20%26%20frequent%20re-evaluation%20to%20be%20effective.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1968' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casey McKinnon not only agreed with this practice, but emphasized the importance of getting your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whole team </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">involved: ‚Äú</span><b>You should continue to revisit your roadmap with your whole team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Make sure you include all the disciplines that you‚Äôre working with on the roadmap and don‚Äôt let it be an artifact of product management, but make it an artifact of the whole company. This way we all agree, we all bought in, and everyone‚Äôs really excited about the roadmap.‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a PM it‚Äôs your responsibility to ensure you‚Äôre sitting with your roadmap consistently, but also making sure you&#8217;re roping in your team. This way alignment is not only easier, but way more consistent.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining an effective agile roadmap¬†is an ongoing process</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile roadmapping is not just creating this pretty document for hand-off and expecting things to fall into place. It‚Äôs a rigorous process that requires ongoing effort. An agile roadmap needs¬†</span><b>flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <strong>constant</strong></span><b>¬†attention</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><b>frequent re-evaluation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be effective. Remember these practices before AND during your roadmapping process and (satisfyingly) watch as your company and plans align. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the founder of a company that creates a tool </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for roadmapping, I‚Äôm very familiar with the mixed¬†opinions surrounding agile product roadmaps. As a methodology, agile says: forget about planning on timelines‚Äîthey‚Äôre unhelpful and hard to meet. On the other hand, roadmaps help you visualize your plans, often on a timeline. <strong>So is the idea of an agile product roadmap counterintuitive? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let‚Äôs take a look at the facts. Agile is used as a term to indicate that teams are very flexible and willing to change their plans on a daily or weekly basis. </span><b>That means your project deadlines and dates are pretty insignificant.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yeah, you can add dates to your plans, but if you‚Äôre being truly agile (i.e. flexible) expect those dates to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a roadmap usually asks: ‚ÄúWhere the heck are we going to be in x amount of time?‚Äù </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we‚Äôve written about before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <strong>not everyone roadmaps along a timeline.</strong> But a roadmap almost always looks to the future beyond the day-to-day and week-to-week, even if you‚Äôre not visually presenting a timeline. A roadmap is a communication tool for aligning your teams, departments and company, so it will usually function on a</span><b> longer-term view beyond short-term cycles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>A roadmap is a statement of intent. Not a literal roadmap.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A%20roadmap%20is%20a%20statement%20of%20intent.%20Not%20a%20literal%20roadmap.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1779' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you‚Äôve got one concept (agile) that sheds the constraints of time and another (roadmapping) that can often seem inherently time-based. Seems pretty counterintuitive. </span><b>But I‚Äôm going to have to respectfully disagree. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agile product roadmap </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a valuable tool and quite frankly, the concept of roadmapping fits rather nicely in an agile environment. Here are some reasons why a roadmap <em>does</em> work for agile‚Äîand why you should be creating one.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why roadmaps are NOT counterintuitive to agile</span></h1>
<p>If we look at the defining characteristics of both agile and roadmapping, as well as the <strong>realities of the real world</strong>, the concepts actually fit nicely together. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Roadmaps change as often as the agile world</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there‚Äôs this basic understanding of agile, at the end of the day, it‚Äôs an umbrella term. You‚Äôve got your scrum shops, your extreme programming teams, your kanban processes and so on. They all fall under ‚Äúagile.‚Äù Each of these methodologies have their own nuances and ways of operating, but ultimately they all share a few major themes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You‚Äôre operating in short cycles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change comes quickly, so you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have to be prepared for it. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a ton of feedback because you‚Äôre operating in cycles that include checkpoints for evaluating your work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These themes are all rooted in the core idea that when functioning in agile </span><b>you must be flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Adaptability is the key to thriving in agile because you‚Äôre always being thrown something new, whether it‚Äôs a new cycle, fresh feedback, or the introduction of a competitor to the market.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>Just as agile functions on transparency, roadmaps create transparency.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Just%20as%20agile%20functions%20on%20transparency%2C%20roadmaps%20create%20transparency.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1779' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we‚Äôve stressed many, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times before </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a roadmap is a statement of intent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs not a literal roadmap</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your roadmap should not be an amalgamation of hard deadlines that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must be met</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It should be an incremental plan that openly embraces change. Nobody has ever created a roadmap that they‚Äôve followed through-and-through. </span><b>Plans can and will alter, and as a result so will your roadmap. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This flexibility of a roadmap (i.e. statement of intent) pairs extremely well with the very nature of agile methodologies. Roadmaps change frequently, allowing them to easily fit into agile settings‚Äîwhich also get reoriented often.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Roadmapping and agile both cut the bullshit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile is all about the hard truth‚Äîwhether you like it or not. Agile methodologies provide realistic versions of how projects are going to play out. If that means a project is going off the rails, you‚Äôre told straight up it‚Äôs going off the rails. This transparency is part of the reason agile has picked up so much steam: it cuts the bullshit about what can or cannot be delivered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as agile settings function on transparency, </span><b>roadmaps create transparency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You build a roadmap to be clear with anyone interested in knowing where the hell you‚Äôre going. It‚Äôs a communication asset designed specifically to align various parties on the what, when and how of your project. And when that plan changes, you present a shiny, updated version. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A roadmap‚Äôs function (<strong>showing transparency</strong>) directly ties into one of the major motivations of adopting an agile methodology (<strong>operating with transparency</strong>). They‚Äôre not in conflict; they fit nicely together.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-300x23.png" width="399" height="30" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-300x23.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-768x58.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-1024x77.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3.png 1515w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. You can‚Äôt escape long-term planning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things I‚Äôve noticed when speaking to PMs from different companies is that many of those who claim to be operating in agile environments actually aren‚Äôt. Okay, they are operating in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form of agile, but there are still waterfall elements mixed in‚Äîso it‚Äôs not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">purely </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">agile. The reason: <strong>as your company grows, the harder it gets to ignore long-term planning</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of startups have successfully adopted an agile mentality that dismisses long-term timelines. But as these companies expand, their stakeholders increase, budgets change, sales targets differ and the need to communicate with more people arises. PMs start juggling </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more variables which means there needs to be a <strong>deeper degree of planning</strong>.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>As your company grows, it gets harder to ignore long-term planning.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=As%20your%20company%20grows%2C%20it%20gets%20harder%20to%20ignore%20long-term%20planning.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1779' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your dev and product teams may be operating in a super-speedy cyclic fashion, but the rest of the growing company is probably not. <strong>The rest of those stakeholders don‚Äôt give a damn about this day-to-day or week-to-week psychology.</strong> They want longer-term visions to plan out hiring, budgeting, resource allocation and more. A roadmap comes into play to address these <strong>long-term goals</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like I mentioned, roadmaps often look beyond a short-term cycle even if they&#8217;re not plotted along a timeline. A roadmap is your opportunity to let stakeholders know how you plan on¬†<strong>supporting your daily or weekly operations as the company evolves</strong>. You get to say, ‚ÄúLook, we have a plan for this company growth we‚Äôre experiencing. This is how we foresee the business evolving to support the daily/weekly tactics for building a better product.‚Äù A roadmap helps tackle the pressures of planning that inevitably creep up on your growing company.</span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does an agile product roadmap look like?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different ways to structure an agile product roadmap. But having spoken to countless product managers, I‚Äôve noticed a few trends. Here are a few quick agile product roadmap examples. (You can find and customize all these examples in our¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates/agile-roadmap?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=counterintuitive" target="_blank">template library</a>.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Swimlane-style roadmaps are especially effective for agile PMs.</strong> For the teams operating in pure agile (i.e. the ones that aren‚Äôt concerned with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dates), it‚Äôs common to organize a roadmap by theme. This means the headers might relate to different areas of product development.</span></p>
<h3 id="theme" style="text-align: center;">Theme-Based Roadmap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1829 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Theme-View.png" alt="theme-based agile product roadmap" width="1173" height="646" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Theme-View.png 1173w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Theme-View-300x165.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Theme-View-768x423.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Theme-View-1024x564.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1173px) 100vw, 1173px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you work in a more structured agile environment, another option is to structure your roadmap by cycle or sprint‚Äîand not link those sprints to specific dates.</span></p>
<h3 id="sprint" style="text-align: center;">Sprint Roadmap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1828 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sprint-View.png" alt="spring agile product roadmap" width="1180" height="838" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sprint-View.png 1180w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sprint-View-300x213.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sprint-View-768x545.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sprint-View-1024x727.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many agile teams also organize their roadmaps according to ‚Äúfuzzy time.‚Äù This means that rather than stating explicit dates, their roadmap might include loose time buckets like </span><b>In Progress</b>,<span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span><b>Future </b>and¬†<strong>Completed</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (</span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an example that takes this structure one step further, inserting loose dates by month or quarter.)</span></p>
<h3 id="fuzzytime" style="text-align: center;">Fuzzy Time Roadmap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1826 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fuzzy-Time-View-1.png" alt="fuzzy time agile product roadmap" width="964" height="841" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fuzzy-Time-View-1.png 964w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fuzzy-Time-View-1-300x262.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fuzzy-Time-View-1-768x670.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you‚Äôre an¬†agile-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ish</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team that‚Äôs still incorporating waterfall elements, your roadmap tends to have dates </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a caveat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your dates closer to the present tend to be more granular, whereas the further along you go the more abstract (i.e. fuzzy) the time headers become. It wouldn‚Äôt be agile if the dates were the be-all-end-all.</span></p>
<h3 id="agileish" style="text-align: center;">Agile-ish Roadmap</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1824 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Agileish-View-1.png" alt="quarterly agile product roadmap" width="1196" height="849" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Agileish-View-1.png 1196w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Agileish-View-1-300x213.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Agileish-View-1-768x545.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Agileish-View-1-1024x727.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1196px) 100vw, 1196px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why you need a roadmap, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your agile environment</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve debunked¬†the argument that roadmaps don‚Äôt <strong><em>belong</em></strong> in agile environments, but why do you actually <strong><em>need</em></strong> one? Some thoughts for the not-yet-convinced:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Align better with your &#8220;makers&#8221;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you say you‚Äôre operating in agile, you‚Äôre most likely referring to your team of &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; These are your <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>product team</strong> and <strong>designers</strong>‚Äîthe ones who put your product together piece-by-piece. Long-term plans are not a pressing priority for a maker. They‚Äôre dedicating big chunks of their workday to building, usually along short(er) delivery cycles. This means they&#8217;re more concerned with what they can accomplish in the next hour, day or week than long-term horizon.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>An agile roadmap better aligns your makers with teams that are working along different timelines.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An%20agile%20roadmap%20better%20aligns%20your%20makers%20with%20teams%20that%20are%20working%20along%20different%20timelines.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1779' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By presenting¬†an agile product roadmap, you signal to your makers that you understand how they function. You‚Äôre committing to short-term priorities, but also pointing out that the future is ‚Äúfuzzy.‚Äù It will be much easier to align with your makers if you position your roadmap as </span><b>a living document that aligns short-term priorities and embraces the future‚Äôs unpredictability.</b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1831 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-1-300x23.png" alt="" width="300" height="23" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-1-300x23.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-1-768x58.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-1-1024x77.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-1.png 1515w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. More cohesion across your company</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While your makers are embodying agile principles, other departments and teams are probably not. Your sales team is working in lengthy sales cycles, your marketing team is concerned about your next release, your customer success team has quarterly goals to hit. <strong>You‚Äôve got this mishmash of timeframes across the company.</strong> And guess who has to align these different psychologies of time? You got it‚Äîthe PM! (Yay‚Ä¶)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agile product roadmap better aligns your makers with teams that are working along different timelines. Teams working under more traditional time constraints may have a lot of questions for the teams that are operating in agile. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this done?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen should we expect this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is my release?!‚Äù Having a roadmap adapted for the agile environment </span><b>communicates realistic goals to internal stakeholders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that may be prying¬†for answers. ¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1833 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-300x23.png" alt="" width="300" height="23" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-300x23.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-768x58.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3-1024x77.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-3.png 1515w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Managing ALL the expectations </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think one of the main fears PMs have about roadmapping is that it‚Äôll be a plan they‚Äôll be held to‚Äîparticularly by internal and external stakeholders. That‚Äôs why we constantly push the &#8220;<a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">statement of intent</a>&#8221; definition for roadmaps. But even then, we understand some people will always choose to take things </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> literally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs the beauty of the agile product roadmap‚Äî</span><b>it gives a PM more flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only does it encompass the intent of a typical roadmap, it also captures the flexibility of the agile methodology. A PM can whip out their roadmap and set expectations more easily. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt set in stone and it will probably change, but it‚Äôs what we‚Äôre proposing.‚Äù</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>The key is to treat your roadmap as a living document that can and will change.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20key%20is%20to%20treat%20your%20roadmap%20as%20a%20living%20document%20that%20can%20and%20will%20change.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=1779' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this baseline understanding established from the start, PMs‚Äô lives are made a hell of a lot easier in the long run. When those unavoidable changes start to happen and the PM is forced to make a tough decision, people will cause less of a fuss because, well, <strong>their expectations were managed at the start</strong>. This reduces the amount of conflict that can come down the pipeline and prepares team members for¬†periods of change.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1834 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-4-300x24.png" alt="" width="300" height="24" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-4-300x24.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-4-768x60.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-4-1024x80.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/agile-dividers-4.png 1515w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: Your agile product roadmap is still a statement of intent</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies nowadays are operating in some form of agile, whether it‚Äôs a purely agile structure or a hybrid of agile principles. Whatever your agile style, a roadmap has solid benefits that fit really nicely into any agile environment. The key is to treat your roadmap as <strong>a living document that can and will change</strong>. In short: a statement of intent.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Effective product roadmaps are often <strong>simple on the surface</strong>. The cleaner and clearer your visualization, the cleaner and clearer your organization‚Äôs sense of shared purpose.</p>
<p>But no matter how slick your final roadmap might look, the roadmapping process can be anything but straightforward. In fact, we talk about ‚Äúroadmapping‚Äù as a skill because it requires such a tricky combination of research, planning and empathy. (And maybe some psychology and/or hypnosis?) To get really good at roadmapping, product managers can‚Äôt just show up to the final meeting. They must learn to navigate a whole smorgasbord of roadmap challenges.</p>
<p>Case in point: a few months back, the following tweet popped up in our mentions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/RoadmunkApp">@RoadmunkApp</a> Ur tagline should be &#8220;create legible product roadmaps without wanting to stab yourself in the face in only 30 min!&#8221;</p>
<p>‚Äî Ellen Beldner (@elbeldner) <a href="https://twitter.com/elbeldner/status/733495571319640068">May 20, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a punchy tagline! But more importantly, this tweet speaks to the <a href="https://roadmunk.com/company" target="_blank">exact reason our founders launched Roadmunk</a>: to make it easier for PMs to <strong>quickly</strong> build <strong>well-designed</strong> roadmaps. (Try¬†our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=challenges" target="_blank">template library</a>¬†to see what we mean.)</p>
<p>Roadmap challenges, however, go far beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs so annoying to build a roadmap in a spreadsheet or slides.‚Äù And the pain points can differ if you‚Äôre at a <strong>startup</strong>, <strong>SME</strong> or <strong>enterprise</strong>. With this fact in mind, we decided to take a holistic view of some of the roadmapping difficulties product managers encounter at different companies.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1414 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Universal_divider-300x84.png" alt="product roadmap challenges" width="450" height="126" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Universal_divider-300x84.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Universal_divider-768x215.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Universal_divider-1024x287.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<h1>Universal pain points</h1>
<p>Some roadmap challenges are equally difficult, regardless of the size or maturity of your company or product.</p>
<p><strong>Setting priorities.</strong> This is a biggie. What should actually go INTO the roadmap? When you have lots of ideas (and demands) swirling around, it&#8217;s difficult to identify which initiatives to tackle and which to sacrifice. Product managers often need to make ‚Äúbig bets‚Äù‚Äîmeaning some smaller projects get the axe. Understanding the benefits and tradeoffs of these decisions is a central challenge not just for roadmapping, but for product management as a whole. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/listentodaniel" target="_blank">Daniel Zacarias</a> wrote an <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-prioritization-techniques/" target="_blank">epic guide to product prioritization</a> that outlines several excellent prioritization methods, including the <strong>Kano Method</strong>, <strong>Value vs. Cost</strong> and a popular technique from <strong>Airbnb‚Äôs Director of Product </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianmcallister" target="_blank">Ian McAllister</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Managing expectations.</strong> What product manager hasn‚Äôt struggled with this? Sales is hungry for features. Executives are wondering why the next release wasn‚Äôt released last week. When you arrive at a roadmap meeting, everyone at the table will be fretting over (and expecting) different things. Is this roadmap going to help me close a deal? How can I build excitement in the market? Am I going to have to go back to the board and say we missed a target? Executives can be especially demanding and/or unrealistic, which is why we wrote <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/managing-executives-roadmapping-process/" target="_blank">an extensive blog on managing execs in the roadmapping process</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Connecting data to the roadmap.</strong>¬†Solid roadmaps are strongly rooted in both empirical and qualitative data that supports the direction of the strategy. Empirical data includes <strong>engagement stats</strong>, business <strong>growth metrics</strong>, and <strong>impact on your market or customers</strong>. Qualitative data includes more emotional‚Äîbut equally essential‚Äîfeedback from your customers. Data is crucial, but it‚Äôs not always easy to <strong>a)</strong> get your hands on it, and <strong>b)</strong> represent data explicitly in your roadmap. New PMs are often enthusiastic about talking to customers‚Äîthen start making assumptions 6 months into their role. Maintaining that energy and curiosity is time-consuming‚Ä¶ but critical.</p>
<blockquote><p>Building roadmaps in legacy tools is a finicky, limiting time-suck.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How to structure your roadmap.</strong> Our roadmap should be on a timeline! No, it¬†shouldn&#8217;t have no dates! No, it should be finger-painted onto the bathroom wall! We often encounter strain around the structure of the roadmap, especially as pressure from the market comes into conflict with the ethos behind agile. We believe this decision should be rooted in culture. If your company values deadlines, your roadmap should reflect that approach. If plans are more loosey-goosey, your roadmap should be, too. Of course, a PM can affect how that culture evolves. <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">Our handy guide</a> outlines 3 basic ways to create a product roadmap, depending on the stage of your product and your culture.</p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs annoying¬†to actually build and share your roadmap.</strong> This goes back to the root of the problem we‚Äôre trying to solve here at Roadmunk. (And what that tweet was all about.) Building roadmaps in legacy tools is a finicky, limiting time-suck. Roadmaps should be living documents that foster transparency, but it‚Äôs very difficult to maintain that spirit without a collaborative dashboard where you can comment, update and view your plan from different angles. If this is a particular sticking point for your organization, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/enterprise-features" target="_blank">check out our full list of features.</a></p>

<h1>Startup challenges: dealing with uncertainty</h1>
<p>In certain ways, roadmapping at a startup is much simpler than roadmapping at a bigger company. There‚Äôs just not as much detail to include. But that lack of certainty and structure introduces other key snags.</p>
<p><strong>Resisting the urge to over-complicate things.</strong> Startup CEOs tend to be ambitious and operationally driven. They want to feel like they‚Äôre a big, multi-million dollar organization right off the bat‚Äîand with a roadmap to match. But including oodles of detail in your early days can actually be counter-productive: it focuses too much on ‚Äúoperations‚Äù and ‚Äúplans‚Äù at a time when the focus should be your product. Also, it doesn‚Äôt leave the door open for enough adaptability. We recommend keeping your roadmap super-simple‚Äîit might just be a simple list of features‚Äîfor as long as possible.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Psst, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/startups?src=hash">#startups</a>. You&#8217;re not an enterprise. And you shouldn&#8217;t build your roadmap the same way they do ü§î <a href="https://t.co/TtOK6BE7dH">https://t.co/TtOK6BE7dH</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
<strong>Accepting change (and guesswork).</strong> Not only should a startup roadmap be simple, it should be 100% subject to change. At this stage, roadmaps are often a ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù of where the market is going and how your product will fit into the landscape. Again, it can be difficult to know when to pivot off your plans. Having a strict roadmap can actually be dangerous for early companies, because it can psychologically commit you to the wrong direction. Big challenge for startup founders and PMs: not getting too married to what‚Äôs on the roadmap.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1415" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SME-divider-300x84.png" alt="small and medium size enteprise roadmap challenges" width="450" height="126" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SME-divider-300x84.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SME-divider-768x215.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/SME-divider-1024x287.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<h1>SME challenges</h1>
<p>As your company becomes more complex, so does your roadmap. And so do the challenges associated with roadmapping.</p>
<p><strong>Simplifying complex strategies.</strong> For startups, a key challenge is not over-complicating things. But as departments expand and your company begins to tackle bigger initiatives, the roadmap needs to accommodate this new complexity. It‚Äôs at this stage that we generally recommend <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">moving your roadmap onto some form of timeline</a>. Finding a way to effectively visualize and communicate all the moving parts can be a head-spinning exercise. Our blog below outlines some startup-specific tactics.</p>
<blockquote><p>The challenge for the roadmap champion is to deeply understand the mindset, progress and problems the product team is facing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Understanding of your product team.</strong> At this stage, there‚Äôs probably more than one PM in the picture. The person who owns the roadmap might not be the same PM who‚Äôs writing stories or communicating regularly with the devs. So the challenge for the roadmap champion is to deeply understand the mindset, progress and problems the product team is facing. Are they resource-strapped? Are they having trouble communicating? Are they in trouble with the competition? Are projects delayed? The challenge: really understanding the internal struggles of the product team and being able to present and communicate that information in a meaningful way.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing the voice of the customer better than anyone else.</strong> As we mentioned above, motivation to talk to customers often peters out. As a company grows and becomes more complex, product managers can get more removed from the central problem and the voice of the customer. Thing is, other departments don‚Äôt lose sight of the customer. Sales can easily derail the roadmap because they‚Äôre in is in constant communication with users, while marketing is tapped into the pulse of the community surrounding your market. If you show up to a roadmap meeting alienated from your customer and their interests, it will show. It should be a daily and conscious task to understand that landscape‚Äîor your roadmap will flop.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1416" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enterprise-divider-300x80.png" alt="enterprise roadmap challenges" width="450" height="120" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enterprise-divider-300x80.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enterprise-divider-768x205.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enterprise-divider-1024x273.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<h1>Enterprise challenges</h1>
<p>Pretty much every SME roadmap challenge also applies to enterprise. But when a company reaches enterprise status, they also have some new wrenches to deflect.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to market trends.</strong> Enterprise is big. Enterprise is slow. Enterprise can be committed to what‚Äôs working now‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs not going to be working for much longer. In the enterprise sphere, product managers must be several steps ahead of the market. It takes a while to turn a big ship, and PMs should anticipate the extra lead time they‚Äôre going to need. And while every PM should be a world-class communicator, enterprise PMs need to be extra savvy when it comes to building stakeholder trust. Otherwise no one will listen‚Äîand your roadmap will soon be stuck in the past.</p>
<blockquote><p>Would you rather be disrupted by yourself or someone else?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Disrupting yourself.</strong> Once you‚Äôre at enterprise level, you‚Äôve pretty much ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù But you‚Äôre also vulnerable to the ‚Äúnext big thing.‚Äù Which begs the question: would you rather be disrupted by yourself or someone else? To avoid the latter fate, your roadmap can‚Äôt just add feature after feature onto your existing schtick. It‚Äôs crucial to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/technology/to-gain-the-upper-hand-amazon-disrupts-itself.html?_r=0" target="_blank">think like Amazon</a> and self-disrupt. At enterprise level, a product manager‚Äôs biggest challenge is to come up with innovative ways to evolve its own product‚Äîthen convince everyone else to get on board. Instead of keeping the wheels in motion, your roadmap needs to lead you on an entirely new path.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roadmapping doesn‚Äôt end once you‚Äôve built your product roadmap. The purpose of your roadmap is to <strong>visualize a transparent plan across your organization</strong>. To ensure your roadmap is effective (and actually, you know, <strong><em>executed</em></strong>), you‚Äôll need to align each team in a roadmap presentation.</p>
<p>Basically, your roadmap is just words on a page (or screen or whiteboard or wall) until it‚Äôs been validated in some form of roadmap presentation or meeting. During a well-executed roadmap presentation, you have the chance to show stakeholders that you understand their motivations‚Äîand they have a chance to publicly affirm their alignment. But if your presentation flops, so might your product strategy.</p>
<h1>What is a roadmap presentation?</h1>
<p>The <strong>most important point</strong> to remember before your roadmap presentation: <strong>this is <em>not</em> the place to get buy-in for your plans</strong>. That might seem contradictory. (After all, we just described roadmap presentations as an opportunity for stakeholders to ‚Äúpublicly affirm their alignment.‚Äù) But it should be <strong>just that</strong>: an <em>affirmation</em> of alignment that was already established <em>prior</em> to the meeting.</p>
<p>(If you‚Äôre butting heads over the alignment process itself, we‚Äôve previously written about <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/get-buy-in-for-your-product-roadmap-from-each-department/" target="_blank">how to get roadmap buy-in from each department</a>. And, more specifically, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/managing-executives-roadmapping-process/" target="_blank">how to get buy-in from executives</a>.)</p>
<p>A roadmap presentation is far more than the words you actually say. <strong>Think of it as an alignment exercise whose success depends on what happens before, during and after you take the stage.</strong> This is an essential chance to <strong>understand stakeholder motivations</strong> and <strong>forge consensus</strong> before moving forward with your plans.</p>
<p>To get nuts-and-bolts-y, we‚Äôve found that roadmap presentations generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term updates:</strong> Taking place <strong>weekly</strong> or <strong>biweekly</strong>, these frequent syncs tend to get in the weeds, covering the particularities of what‚Äôs getting built and how that affects other departments. This type of sit-down would be more common on smaller teams. And because these catch-ups happen regularly, formal buy-in before the presentation is not imperative. But the roadmap still needs to be communicated prior to the meeting to avoid any major surprises or backlash.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term updates:</strong> For bigger organizations and teams, the roadmap presentation will likely happen <strong>monthly</strong>, <strong>bimonthly</strong> or even <strong>quarterly</strong>. For these conversations, buy-in before the meeting is critical. These meetings can often involve high-stakes projects that rely on massive alignment and dependencies. Show up to your presentation without everyone on board, and you‚Äôll probably leave feeling pretty beat-up.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-1338 size-thumbnail aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Divider_prep-150x150.png" alt="Divider_prep" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>Before your roadmap presentation: how to prepare</h1>
<p>When it comes to roadmap presentations, the pre-game is just as important as the main event. There are 5 areas you should learn inside-out to ensure a productive meeting:</p>
<p><strong>Know the high-level strategy.</strong><br />
So you‚Äôre going to build feature X, Y and Z‚Äîbut what‚Äôs the big-picture goal those features address? Without being able to speak to the <strong>high-level strategy</strong>‚Äîand the <strong>tradeoffs</strong> that must be made to <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-prioritization-techniques/" target="_blank">prioritize within that strategy</a>‚Äîeveryone will just start asking for whatever is most advantageous to <em>them</em>. Be able to speak to <strong>product vision</strong><em> and</em> <strong>company vision</strong>‚Äîand how your roadmap aligns with both targets.</p>
<p><strong>Know the business model.</strong><br />
This goes deeper than just knowing the product goals and company vision. As a product manager, you‚Äôre facilitating <strong>revenue growth</strong>. You should be able to articulate how your roadmap will increase ARR or ACV (or your acronym of choice), create demand, and help you hit (or exceed) sales forecasts. Not only does this tie your roadmap to the hard realities of your business&#8230; it will help you win your sales team‚Äôs heart.</p>

<p><strong>Know your customers.</strong><br />
Qualitative data can be just as important as numbers. Before any roadmap presentation, make sure you‚Äôve spoken to (at least) a handful of key customers, and can relay their views. This is essential for building trust that your roadmap is grounded in the <strong>real-life needs of the market</strong>‚Äînot just projections in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p><strong>Know the stakeholders.</strong><br />
We mean <em>actually</em> get to know them: their <strong>motivations</strong>, their <strong>deadlines</strong>, their <strong>pressures</strong>, what‚Äôs keeping them up at night. <strong>Again, trust is crucial.</strong> Marketing and sales needs to feel that product decisions are sound‚Äîotherwise they might go rogue. This won‚Äôt happen overnight. But it‚Äôs important to invest the time.</p>
<p><strong>Know the resource constraints.</strong><br />
One of the most common (inevitable?) pushbacks you‚Äôre going to get is related to<em> time</em>.<strong> ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we move faster?‚Äù</strong> To counter this complaint, it‚Äôs absolutely crucial that you have an inside-out knowledge of your resources at any given time. You must be able to clearly articulate the resources required to execute a given task‚Äîand the tradeoffs that will be made if you swap in something else. It can also be useful to discuss historical timelines, reminding the room of how long things have taken in the past.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1340 size-thumbnail" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Divider_what-to-show-150x150.png" alt="Divider_what to show" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>During your roadmap presentation: What to actually present</h1>
<p>As we‚Äôve discussed, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">there‚Äôs no<strong> one</strong> way to slice your roadmap</a>. So what should you actually show during your roadmap presentation?</p>
<p>We can‚Äôt tell you exactly how to build a roadmap that suits your particular organization or product (that&#8217;s where our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=presentation" target="_blank">template library</a>¬†comes in handy), but we do recommend that you aim to meet at least a few of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Does your roadmap distinguish between what‚Äôs <strong>planned</strong> and what‚Äôs still <strong>TBD</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Does it address the individual needs of each department and/or stakeholder?</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Can you iterate on the roadmap <em>during the presentation itself</em>?</li>
<li><strong>Clarity + Attractiveness:</strong> Does it look good? Is the plan visualized in a clear manner? Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of good design.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below, we‚Äôve included some options for structuring your roadmap for your presentation. With a <a href="https://roadmunk.com/">dedicated roadmapping tool like Roadmunk</a>, you can easily create and present multiple pivots of the same data. For these examples, we used our <strong>C-Level Roadmap Template</strong>, <a href="http://support.roadmunk.com/Roadmap-Templates">available here.</a></p>
<h2>1) Flexibility</h2>
<p>Many product managers find it helpful to communicate which initiatives are actually in the pipeline, and which are still subject to change. One of our favourite ways to structure a roadmap is to organize items by <strong>In Progress</strong>, <strong>Scheduled</strong> and <strong>Proposed</strong>. If your organization works on a timeline, you can simply colour code the items on your roadmap.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1312 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.35.49-PM.png" alt="Timeline flexible roadmap presentation" width="1147" height="630" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.35.49-PM.png 1147w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.35.49-PM-300x165.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.35.49-PM-768x422.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.35.49-PM-1024x562.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1147px) 100vw, 1147px" /></p>
<p>If your organization prefers to avoid timelines, you could also create a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> with the headers <strong>In Progress</strong>, <strong>Scheduled</strong> or <strong>Proposed</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1314" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flexible_swimlane-276x300.png" alt="Flexible swimlane roadmap presentation" width="550" height="599" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flexible_swimlane-276x300.png 276w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Flexible_swimlane.png 686w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve found this roadmap structure very effective for reducing backlash during a roadmap presentation. Stakeholders get a clear and immediate visual indication of which features are <strong>actually committed</strong>, and which are <strong>still being decided</strong>. Overall, it means you‚Äôre less likely to hear knee-jerk peanut gallery protestations.</p>
<h2>2) Personalization</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, it can also be effective to visualize ownership during your roadmap presentation. A great way to do this is to organize your roadmap by department or even by the individual responsible for each task.</p>
<p>The roadmap below includes the same data as the roadmaps above, but we‚Äôve included subheaders indicating individual ownership over each project.</p>

<p>If you really want to get granular with ownership, you could create a <strong>Swimlane View</strong> roadmap that highlights department, resource or individual owner. This puts the focus on who‚Äôs doing what for which department‚Äînot the timeline.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1322" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.48.58-PM-300x212.png" alt="Swimlane ownership roadmap presentation" width="600" height="425" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.48.58-PM-300x212.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.48.58-PM-768x543.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-02-at-5.48.58-PM.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>3) Collaboration</h2>
<p>There‚Äôs a reason why the sticky-notes-on-a-wall method is such an enduring way to make a roadmap: it‚Äôs easy to change things up on the fly. Although you‚Äôd ideally have buy-in for your roadmap before the presentation, your meeting will go much smoother if you are also able to update your roadmap during the conversation.</p>
<p>With a tool like Roadmunk, you can easily add comments or adjust your roadmap directly within the app during the meeting. This makes for a much more dynamic and participatory presentation.</p>

<h2>4) Clarity + Attractiveness</h2>
<p>The core purpose of your roadmap is to visualize your strategy and make it crystal-clear to everyone in your organization. ‚ÄúMake something pretty!‚Äù may sound trite, but you‚Äôll undermine your end-goal if your roadmap is unattractive or unclear.</p>
<p>Obviously, the content of your roadmap is more important than the appearance of your roadmap. But it will be a lot easier to highlight key information‚Äîno matter how complicated‚Äîif your visualization is easy on the eyes. Also recommended: custom branding.</p>

<h1>What pushback should you prep for?</h1>
<p>No matter how much you prepare, there are some common points of friction that come up again and again in roadmap meetings. A great way to ace your presentation: prepare for the pushback before it starts pushing. Here are some common questions to expect.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúAre you actually going to achieve this timeline?‚Äù</strong><br />
You‚Äôll most frequently hear this from sales or execs. They want to confirm that your roadmap is realistic so they can plan accordingly. If you have a history of late delivery, be prepared to address why <strong><em>this time</em></strong> will be different. (Then make sure your deliver.)</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúHow can we scope this down?‚Äù</strong><br />
Just because stakeholders are skeptical that you can hit your deadlines doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt want things to go faster. One way to ship features quicker: scope them down. Especially at startups, executives might push the ‚ÄúM‚Äù in MSP when they see scope creep getting out of hand. Be prepared to answer why you‚Äôve scoped each feature to its current specs‚Äîand be flexible when it‚Äôs possible to scope things down.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the value of this roadmap?‚Äù</strong><br />
Don‚Äôt just speak to the qualitative value of each new feature. Be prepared with hard numbers. How will this roadmap help achieve your revenue targets? What specific clients or market segment does it address? You should be able to tie items on your roadmap to specific dollar-sign potential, and articulate value vs. effort. (<a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-prioritization-techniques/">More on that here.</a>)</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWhat are the maintenance costs going to be?‚Äù</strong><br />
The cost of maintenance is one of the things most commonly neglected on the roadmap‚Äî<a href="http://firstround.com/review/The-one-cost-engineers-and-product-managers-dont-consider/">even though it‚Äôs one of the most important and resource-draining aspects of any organization.</a> Expect more technically inclined team members to pipe up with maintenance questions, or simply visualize maintenance initiatives directly on your roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWhere are the risks or dependencies?‚Äù</strong><br />
Sure, the roadmap looks great.. But what factors that could derail its execution? What risks does each stakeholder need to be aware of, and how will that affect their department‚Äôs ability to reach their targets? Also, what steps can stakeholders take to pitch in and mitigate those dangers? The more honest you are about the realities facing your roadmap, the more likely you‚Äôll build trust‚Äîand get buy-in for your plan.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1341 size-thumbnail" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Divider_rm-done-150x150.png" alt="Divider_rm done" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>What happens after the presentation?</h1>
<p>Alignment is a continuous process. <strong>It doesn‚Äôt just end when your meeting is finished.</strong> Make sure you follow up your roadmap presentation with thorough meeting notes and the updated roadmap. (Check out <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/writing-for-product-strategy-alignment/" target="_blank">our recent interview</a>¬†with <strong>Ellen Chisa</strong>, <strong>VP of Product at Lola</strong>, for some tips on writing kickass meeting notes and sync emails.) Create a concrete space‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs within an email, a shared document, or your roadmap itself‚Äîwhere stakeholders can share feedback.</p>
<h1>Reminder! The #1 way to fail your roadmap presentation</h1>
<p>Don‚Äôt forget that the fastest way to fail your roadmap presentation is to <strong>not talk to anyone beforehand</strong>. Your presentation is <em>all about alignment</em>. Set the tone <em>before</em> your presentation by talking to‚Äîand, more importantly <em>listening to</em>‚Äîeach stakeholder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‚ÄúI spend all this time working on my roadmap, then it gets picked apart. How can I wrangle execs in the roadmapping process?‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs one of the questions we hear most often from product managers when it comes to roadmapping. The product manager has one plan‚Äîexecutives see things differently. They butt heads, tweak plans, shift priorities, and ultimately who knows if the right thing gets built. Or gets built well. It‚Äôs not only frustrating, it can hurt both the success of the product and the product manager‚Äôs career.</p>
<p>Roadmunk‚Äôs CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/LatifNanji" target="_blank">Latif</a>, learned this lesson the hard way. About two years into his PM career, he was given the opportunity to start creating and managing his own roadmap. Latif is currently on vacation in Portugal (which is not relevant to this blog post, but we‚Äôre jealous?), so he emailed his story:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1232 size-large aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_email-1-1024x397.png" alt="Managing execs_email" width="640" height="248" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_email-1-1024x397.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_email-1-300x116.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_email-1-768x298.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_email-1.png 1342w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Latif failed to understand the importance of executive feedback to the roadmapping process. He was used to dealing with devs, product managers and customers‚Äîso that‚Äôs who he spoke to. But product managers need to be horizontal across an <em>entire organization</em>. And they need to understand the business side as much as the technical side. Which means getting buy-in from those at the top of <em>every</em> department.</p>
<p>The process isn‚Äôt easy. We previously wrote about¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/get-buy-in-for-your-product-roadmap-from-each-department/">getting buy-in for your roadmap from each department</a>, but we wanted to delve deeper into <strong>executive</strong> buy-in, since it can be particularly challenging. Here‚Äôs a quick survival guide for your next exec meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1239 size-thumbnail" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_dividers-1-150x150.png" alt="Managing execs_dividers 1" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>Pushback isn‚Äôt a bad thing</h1>
<p>Reminder to PMs: It can be frustrating when your airtight roadmap gets punctured by an exec. But the goal of the roadmapping process isn‚Äôt to present a perfect plan that everyone immediately loves. Getting feedback‚Äîeven negative feedback‚Äî<em>is</em> the goal. The purpose of presenting your roadmap, then iterating (and iterating again) is to get¬†everyone on the same page. It‚Äôs about managing and aligning expectations. Yes, the snags can be frustrating. But if no one is criticizing, no one is listening. Think of it as a opportunity to fill gaps in your knowledge about the other departments you work with.</p>
<h1>Before showing your roadmap to an exec‚Ä¶</h1>
<p>There‚Äôs no point in showing your roadmap to an executive until you have a shared understanding of where you want the roadmap to take you. Generally, this means that everyone in the room understands:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company vision:</strong> What‚Äôs the longterm goal of the company? Is it to grow as big as possible, or is it to get acquired? Are you after exponential growth or a more gradual trajectory? Have there been significant changes in company vision lately? These are the types of questions that should be understood <em>before</em> the roadmap meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Product strategy:</strong> What problem does your product solve for? <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/">At what stage of the chasm</a> are you currently operating? What‚Äôs your plan of attack or differentiation in the market? Is your goal to have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2015/07/17/every-startups-go-to-market-strategy-has-to-answer-the-100-million-question/#ae42112523ff">10 customers paying $1,000,000 per year, or 1,000,000 customers paying $10 per year?</a>¬†These questions will heavily impact what‚Äôs on your product roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization method:</strong> How do you prioritize? Having an established prioritization method, and being transparent about that method, is essential when explaining how you built your roadmap in the first place. (And if you don‚Äôt know where to start, our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/listentodaniel">Daniel Zacarias</a> wrote <a href="http://foldingburritos.com/product-prioritization-techniques/">an epic post on prioritization over at his site, Folding Burritos</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these points is a blog post unto itself, so we‚Äôre not going to get into too much detail here. (The purpose of <em>this</em> post is to discuss what happens when you show the first iteration of your roadmap to an exec.) Just keep in mind that you‚Äôll need a strong sense of these three items to productively communicate with an executive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1241 size-thumbnail" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_dividers-2-150x150.png" alt="Managing execs_dividers 2" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>Know your audience</h1>
<p>Speaking of executives, remember that they are not all clones of each other. The CEO does not have the same concerns as the CPO, who does not have the same priorities as the CMO. Yes, you‚Äôre all working towards the same company vision‚Äîbut you‚Äôre each chipping away at different areas of that vision. Your roadmap discussion should be tailored to the specialization of whichever exec happens to be in the room with you.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when addressing a few different types of execs:</p>
<p><strong>The CEO:</strong> Especially at startups, the CEO tends to be pretty hands-on with the product roadmap. CEOs think high-level and inter-departmental. They‚Äôre not just going to want to see what features you‚Äôre adding, but rather how the evolution of the product will touch the other teams and grow the business. They also want to understand risk and internal efficiencies (or inefficiencies).</p>
<p><strong>The sales exec:</strong> Sales tends to be more timeline-focused. And they have lots of competing demands. Come prepared to show what they‚Äôll be able to offer customers, how you arrived at that decision (including any tradeoffs that were made), and how you&#8217;re allocating resources (in case they make demands). Especially if you‚Äôre a new PM, be sure to unearth any promises sales has made to customers‚Äîthat‚Äôs one of the main reasons roadmaps get bumped off course.</p>

<p><strong>The marketing exec:</strong> They don‚Äôt need to know every detail of how a feature is going to get built, but they do need to know the stories they can tell. As best you can, flag what‚Äôs coming up in the long-term so they can prepare.</p>
<p><strong>The product exec:</strong> Roadmapping is always about getting feedback, but that‚Äôs especially relevant when the exec is a fellow product manager. Here‚Äôs where you can really get in the weeds on your market. Explain what direction your market is going, and how your roadmap builds a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Along with not<em> telling</em> each exec the same thing, you also don‚Äôt have to <em>show</em> them the same thing. We recommend tailoring your roadmap to its specific audience. For example, your complete product roadmap might look something like this when plotted on a timeline:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1235 size-full aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managing-execs-in-the-roadmapping-process_roadmap1.png" alt="managing execs in the roadmapping process_roadmap1" width="1135" height="653" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managing-execs-in-the-roadmapping-process_roadmap1.png 1135w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managing-execs-in-the-roadmapping-process_roadmap1-300x173.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managing-execs-in-the-roadmapping-process_roadmap1-768x442.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managing-execs-in-the-roadmapping-process_roadmap1-1024x589.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1135px) 100vw, 1135px" /></p>
<p>However, when showing your roadmap to an exec in marketing or sales, you could show the same data plotted according to what&#8217;s <strong>in progress</strong>, <strong>in design</strong> or <strong>in the backlog</strong>. This is a simple framework that can go a long way when it comes to managing expectations.</p>

<h1>Common reasons for pushback</h1>
<p>Why would an executive question your roadmap? A good way to prevent pushback: be prepared for some of the obvious points of contention.</p>
<p><strong>1. They don‚Äôt think the roadmap is aggressive enough.</strong> Is that all? Shouldn‚Äôt you be able to complete, oh, at least three more features this quarter? Obviously, everyone wants more and they want it last week. Executives are highly incentivized to over-deliver‚Äîand they won‚Äôt be timid about asking for ‚Äúextra.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Be very transparent about resourcing. Explain how your available manpower will be used to execute each item on your roadmap. In fact, show resources right on your roadmap. Also, show history. Remind them how long past features took to execute, and how the new items will compare.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. They think the roadmap is too aggressive (i.e. unrealistic).</strong> One thing you don‚Äôt want to do: over-promise and under-deliver. If an exec sees a roadmap that just isn‚Äôt doable, they are likely to push back. Especially if sales will be sharing their roadmap with clients.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> This is most commonly a problem for more junior PMs who don‚Äôt yet understand the cadence of their team. Take the feedback, apply it&#8230; and learn for next time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. They have their own agenda.</strong> Remember Latif‚Äôs story? He didn‚Äôt communicate with sales, and it turned out they had made a major promise to a customer that was not accounted for in the product roadmap. He was blindsided‚Äîthen scrambling to catch up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Long before you present your roadmap to an exec, make sure you know if they have any unspoken-for priorities. That way these items can be properly assessed and prioritized, without derailing your plans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. They don‚Äôt understand the technical side.</strong> This often goes hand-in-hand with #1. A non-technical executive might look at your roadmap and wonder: why is everything taking so long? Do we really need that many resources allocated to technical maintenance and debt?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> From Day 1, explain the process. The explain it again. If an executive doesn‚Äôt have a technical background, they probably have never been exposed to the huge amount of resources that must go into simply maintaining a system. Remember, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/how-non-technical-product-managers-can-jump-the-skills-gap/">product managers are translators</a>: it&#8217;s your job to interpret your roadmap for each department.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. They want to see more of the big picture.</strong> Really early products can get away with a roadmap that‚Äôs just a list of features. But once your product begins to mature, you‚Äôre going to have to account for other departments, dependencies and risks, and be able to position your roadmap within the wider market. If an exec doesn‚Äôt see this on the roadmap, they‚Äôll probably ask about it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Check yourself on granularity. Yes, you need to know every detail about how a feature will be built. But does the executive? Be able to explain your roadmap not just in terms of how/why you prioritized the way you did, but how this will lead to your specific goals within your specific market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. They‚Äôre jerks:</strong> Sometimes people just suck. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time an executive was confrontational or egocentric. It can be very challenging when someone pushes back on your roadmap because they just, well, want to be difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick tip:</strong> Fight aggression with questions. Ask what they would like to be different. This doesn‚Äôt mean saying yes, but make yourself open to the conversation‚Äîthen explain the tradeoffs if you execute ‚Äútheir‚Äù way.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1242 size-thumbnail" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Managing-execs_dividers-3-150x150.png" alt="Managing execs_dividers 3" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<h1>A few more things to keep in mind</h1>
<p>Seasoned product managers are <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-product-manager/">world-class communicators</a>. But it takes work to get there. Here are a few key points to keep in mind when presenting your product roadmap to an executive.</p>
<p><strong>Know your market better than anyone else.</strong> At least, that‚Äôs the goal. Executives will often ‚Äúwin‚Äù a roadmapping debate because they have been in the business longer and simply know the landscape better. Your goal: learn everything you don‚Äôt know, everything they know, and more. Talk to more customers than them, keep tabs on your competitors more closely than them, and be the expert on your market.</p>
<p><strong>Be radically transparent.</strong> Don‚Äôt just show your roadmap. Explain how you got there. Resourcing, risk and prioritization should all be crystal clear. Then you‚Äôll be able to show how all the pieces will move if anything changes.</p>
<p><strong>Show tradeoffs.</strong> When a change to your roadmap is suggested, make sure you articulate the tradeoffs. Sure, we could do X‚Äîbut we‚Äôd have to sacrifice Y. What will the domino effect be from that? Be open to any change‚Äîbut make sure you articulate the full picture of the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Remind them of history.</strong> Not sure how long something will take? Look backwards. Due to the cost of maintaining your existing tech, features often take longer to build over time, not faster. Come to the conversation with both a strong sense of where you‚Äôre going, and knowledge of your past.</p>
<p><strong>Tailor what you show.</strong> Not all execs are the same. And they shouldn‚Äôt all see the same version of your roadmap. To ensure a successful roadmapping process, show each stakeholder the information that best applies to them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember: feedback isn&#8217;t a bad thing!</strong> Feedback is what you<em> want</em> as a PM. If you‚Äôre not getting feedback (even bad feedback), no one is listening.</p>
