				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending out invites to our first <strong>Product &amp; Pizza</strong> event felt reminiscent of sending out invites to our first grade school party. We were excited, but nervous, but super optimistic. We had a riveting line-up of panelists: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/seema-lakhani" target="_blank">Seema Lakhani</a> from <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/brandonmchu" target="_blank">Brandon Chu</a> from <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ninaspirou">Christina Perdikoulias</a> from <a href="https://www.bluecatnetworks.com/" target="_blank">BlueCat Networks</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/atawfiq" target="_blank">Ali Tawfiq</a> from <a href="https://500px.com/home" target="_blank">500px</a>. We had a theme </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product person could talk endlessly about: <strong>great mistakes</strong>. And we had pizza. Lots of it. So we thought, ‚ÄúOkay, this should turn out well‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward a couple months and we‚Äôve got over <strong>100 of Toronto‚Äôs savviest product people</strong> crammed into one room. First thought: shit, we‚Äôre going to need a bigger venue. Followed-by:<strong> this is gonna be an awesome night</strong>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our panelists aired their dirty, messy product mistakes and shared lessons learned‚Äîrelevant for PMs of any level. Our attendees engaged and networked the hell out of our panelists and each other. And not a single slice of pizza was leftover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who missed out, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e put together a short video asking some of our panelists, attendees and fellow Roadmunkers to talk about their biggest rookie product mistakes‚Ä¶ and pizza. Check out our event wrap-up below:</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUaJgD-XJ-o?ecver=1" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, our verdict for the night? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Product people + pizza + great mistakes = successful product meetup</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we aren‚Äôt even done. This was only our first product meetup. We‚Äôre already planning for the fall, with a completely different theme (and a much bigger venue!). So if Product &amp; Pizza has got you hungry for more (figuratively and literally), follow us on your social network of choice‚Äî<a href="https://twitter.com/RoadmunkApp" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roadmunkapp/" target="_blank">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/roadmunk" target="_blank">here</a>‚Äîand watch out for details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on that note, we‚Äôll leave you with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1573625049379209.1073741829.949003375174716&amp;type=1&amp;l=11f50939b2" target="_blank">some pictures</a>¬†and favourite tweets from the night.

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve been Roadmunk‚Äôs newest product manager for 120 days (give-or-take). And while it‚Äôs been a career-changing gig full of growth, it‚Äôs also been&#8230; peculiar. I say peculiar for a couple of reasons: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I joined a product organization as a product manager for a tool for other product managers. Feels like some weird Inception shit sometimes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmunk is a small product organization, so <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I report to and work with our CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji/" target="_blank">Latif Nanji</a>. It‚Äôs to the point where I feel like my notebooks are filled with more of his ‚Äúnotes‚Äù than mine. Take this lovely uh, diagram for example.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2402 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Latif_note-1024x636.jpg" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Latif's notes" width="640" height="398" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Latif_note-1024x636.jpg 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Latif_note-300x186.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Latif_note-768x477.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working directly with Latif has been one of the most intriguing (and challenging) parts of my first 120 days at Roadmunk. The reason: <strong>I have to manage up A LOT</strong>. Latif was a PM before he founded Roadmunk, so he‚Äôs still a PM at heart. It‚Äôs intimidating to step into a new PM role and report not only to a CEO, but an experienced PM-turned-CEO. I‚Äôve had to prove to Latif he doesn‚Äôt have to own product decisions; I can. <strong>I can take his learnings and insights and turn them into actionable results for the product team</strong>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><hr /><p><em>To be at the CEO‚Äôs level of decision-making, I had to see eye-to-eye with him.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=To%20be%20at%20the%20CEO%E2%80%99s%20level%20of%20decision-making%2C%20I%20had%20to%20see%20eye-to-eye%20with%20him.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2393' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won‚Äôt say I‚Äôve managed up 100% in four months, but I recently had a breakthrough when pitching Latif a new user onboarding initiative. Research, competitive analysis, options, reasons why, a proposed solution‚Äîthe whole package. The conversation ended with him stating, ‚ÄúWhy are you talking to me about this? You have all the answers. Go ahead!‚Äù Huh? What the hell just happened? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interaction got me wondering what I did right. So I collected my own thoughts on how I got to the point of Latif finally trusting me to own product decisions. <strong>These are some practical steps I‚Äôve taken to manage up in my first 4 months here at Roadmunk</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2432" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_1.jpg" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Nick and Latif" width="1500" height="1000" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Staying n‚Äôsync </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don‚Äôt judge me for the boy band reference. To be at the CEO‚Äôs level of decision-making, I had to see eye-to-eye with him. That meant <strong>frequent communication</strong>. We (Product and Latif) have a weekly sync every Monday on product strategy. Each sync I define a weekly goal for the product team to align on and achieve. Also walk-and-talks. It‚Äôs refreshing to grab Latif, step outside for fresh air and sync up on strategic initiatives and product vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great part about working every day, all day with the CEO is I get the latest information. I get a true reflection of how our company operates at every level. From new hires to departments to even the board level. These syncs show Latif <strong>I‚Äôve extracted insights from what he regularly shares with me</strong> and <strong>I can distill that information to our product team</strong>. I can turn his jumble of input (and believe me, it can be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">jumble</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) into actionable output for us to move forward with. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Sharing the workload </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way I‚Äôve managed up is by putting things on my table that I know are big time sinks for Latif. He‚Äôs a very hands-on CEO; he likes to meet with customers and be roped into customer inquiries of larger accounts. But I know that‚Äôs a huge time sink for him. So what I‚Äôve done in the background is I started joining more of those customer conversations so that I can take that load off of him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking away some of that responsibility (and making it explicitly clear) shows Latif that<strong> I can do what he can do</strong>. That stamp of approval doesn‚Äôt always need to come from you Latif, I can create that stamp instead bud.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2427" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_2.jpg" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Nick and Latif" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_2.jpg 1500w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_2-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Just say no</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are like a million posts on saying no. ‚ÄúLearn how to say no as a PM.‚Äù ‚ÄúSaying no is important for PMs.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy saying no will make you the best PM EVER!‚Äù The sheer number of them can make someone jaded to this insight. But honestly, learning to say no (and confidently) is a key component of how I gained Latif‚Äôs trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Latif and I had a meeting with our marketing team about an upcoming promotional event. Latif jumped the gun in terms of what could be achieved on product‚Äôs side before the event. Had I been too scared to say anything‚Äîand say no, that‚Äôs not possible‚Äîour marketing team would have a very different perspective of our product vision.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><hr /><p><em>As PMs, we should be a wealth of product knowledge‚Äîespecially at startups.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=As%20PMs%2C%20we%20should%20be%20a%20wealth%20of%20product%20knowledge%E2%80%94especially%20at%20startups.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2393' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>My job as the product manager is to align everyone, INCLUDING our CEO</strong>. Being able to say, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not happening,‚Äù and explain why, is part of how I show Latif that I can speak to product vision and ensure alignment no matter who I‚Äôm speaking with. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Pushing the needle forward (i.e. extra initiative)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be blunt with you, my plate is full everyday at Roadmunk. Like brimming to the rim full. If my plate can only contain 100%, I‚Äôll still put 150% on my plate. If I get 90% of that done, I‚Äôm not a happy camper. Hit about 120% or more, then you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">may</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see some pearly whites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I‚Äôve built a cadence of work that I share daily with Latif. <strong>I‚Äôll put more than I can chew off on my plate</strong> and during our daily standups, I‚Äôll voice exactly what I did yesterday and what I plan on tackling today. Even when it seems like a shit show, this process shows Latif I can get shit done. No excuses.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Earning my fellow Roadmunkers&#8217; trust</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the biggest way I‚Äôve gained Latif‚Äôs trust is by showing him that I can communicate with other Roadmunk departments. I firmly believe <strong>PMs should be THE main point of contact for each department regarding anything product-related</strong>. As PMs, we should be a wealth of product knowledge‚Äîespecially at startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made it a point to build <strong>inter-departmental relationships</strong>. I established myself as a trustworthy (and reliable) repository of product info for my fellow Roadmunkers. (Having a clear roadmap definitely helped here;¬†<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=managingup" target="_blank">try a template out</a>.) Proving myself to other departments gave me more ammo when working with Latif because it provided him with a better consensus of me. Sure, he has his opinions about me, but how did everyone else feel? Affirmation from others gives Latif confidence to offload more stuff onto me.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2443" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_3.jpg" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Nick and Latif" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_3.jpg 1500w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-Nick_Latif_3-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions straight from the squirrel (a.k.a. Latif)</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can go on about how I think I managed up to Latif, but I thought opinions straight from the squirrel‚Äôs mouth would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be valuable. (Context: I‚Äôve fondly nicknamed him the squirrel because this man connects idea to idea like a really energetic squirrel.) Bugging him a few times, I got him to divulge his real opinions about how I‚Äôve developed our working relationship so far.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2408 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-1.png" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Slack conversation" width="662" height="480" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-1.png 662w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-1-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more context‚Äôs sake, Latif has 3 things he looks for in a new PM:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotional intelligence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inherent capability to hold a ton of information and dispense it accordingly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ability to sell the product you‚Äôre making</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it seems like I was able to hit those three points for Latif, but when exactly did he realize that?</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2410 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-2.png" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Slack conversation" width="663" height="518" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-2.png 663w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-2-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, so he technically had an answer. My ‚Äòjourney‚Äô to prove myself was (and still is) an ongoing process. And while Latif‚Äôs attributed my path to several different factors, I had to find out if he was influenced by my inter-departmental relationships from these past few months. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2413 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-3.png" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Slack conversation" width="657" height="420" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-3.png 657w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-3-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like this is the point I should be swelling with pride, but it can‚Äôt be all praise.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be something I could have done to better gain Latif‚Äôs trust. On my end I think I definitely could have started talking to customers sooner. A lot of the time I‚Äôm able to influence Latif when I have customer information to back up my decisions.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2414 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-4.png" alt="Managing up as a newbie product manager - Slack conversation" width="656" height="400" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-4.png 656w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/managing_up-slack-4-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was taking correct steps to prove myself to Latif, it would have definitely helped to have dove head first into the product management space before starting my gig. Learn the ins &amp; outs of the space and see what product managers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do, beforehand.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to managing up: manage in all directions</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Latif mentioned, being a PM not only means managing up to eager, energetic (and squirrelish) upper management, but it also means <strong>managing horizontally</strong>. Managing one damn direction is hard enough, why we gotta deal with both? Unfortunately, it comes with the territory. But managing horizontally is one of the best ways to show upper management that you can grasp those difficult product decisions. ¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To newbie PMs learning to manage up, I say: ask me over LinkedIn ;). But in all seriousness, <strong>prepare to do extra legwork</strong>. I haven‚Äôt gotten there completely (duh‚Äîit‚Äôs been just over 4 months), but I‚Äôm getting there. Just take a deep plunge into as many business aspects as you can because that‚Äôs your job. Understand every aspect between metrics, customers, blockers, departments, markets and strategies. Use this information to make those damn decisions and earn that trust.¬†</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It‚Äôs probably the most common question I hear from young entrepreneurs. They‚Äôre looking for that elusive developer who doesn‚Äôt just know how to scale a code base‚Äîthey can also scale a team. All while balancing the business priorities. </span></p>
<p><strong>So how did I find my co-founder Tomas? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a technical co-founder was not easy. Not only do you have to share ideas about how to grow a company, you also need to agree on what you want from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your particular </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">company. Do you want the pressures (and potential payoffs) of venture funding, or would you prefer to build a lifestyle business? What kind of culture do you want to create? What‚Äôs the end-game? Those are deep questions that relate to your <strong>values</strong>, <strong>life stage</strong>, and <strong>prior experience</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here goes. My thoughts on finding a technical co-founder.</span></p>
<!-- This site is converting visitors into subscribers and customers with OptinMonster - https://optinmonster.com :: Campaign Title: Blog signup inline --><div id="om-ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg-holder"></div><script>var ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg,ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg){ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg=new OptinMonsterApp();return ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg.init({"u":"25630.595075","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="https://a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg=new OptinMonsterApp();ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg.init({"u":"25630.595075","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");</script><!-- / OptinMonster -->
<h1>Step 1: Learn the language</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you move to Spain and want to make friendly with the locals, what‚Äôs the very first thing you need to know? Spanish. Otherwise, they won&#8217;t understand a thing you‚Äôre saying. Likewise, <strong>a developer speaks a different language from you</strong>. They use words like EC2, client and server, iterations, ruby on rails and refactoring. You use words like product discovery, revenue, inbound generation and pricing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you want to get married for the next 7 years and make an exit of $1 billion? Comprendo? No entiendo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning their language isn‚Äôt hard, but it‚Äôs not something you can do in an hour. I don&#8217;t mean look these words up on Google. I mean really know them. Spend a few months in your evenings learning how to code. You will get to know the basics, but more importantly appreciate what a developer does. I spent five years in product management, which gave me a shoe in the door and <strong>a lot of empathy</strong> <strong>for the development process</strong>.</span></p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-2128" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Latif.gif" alt="Technical co-founder - Latif GIF" width="350" height="232" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-2117" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tomas.gif" alt="Technical co-founder - Tomas GIF" width="350" height="233" /></center></p>
<h1>Step 2: Errr, dating?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great, you&#8217;ve now missed a bunch of weekend socials because you were trying to hit level 3 on </span><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment of time you realized you (and me!) picked the wrong degree in university. Oops. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to still be in school, stop reading this and find the class schedule for computer science. Go and meet people and start making friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if you&#8217;re past that phase in life?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might find yourself on co-founder dating sites. I will save you the trouble: <strong>it‚Äôs a big waste of time</strong>. I interviewed over 50 developers, whether it was online or in person, and none of them had put in the time to understand what a startup </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involves in terms of the dedication and hard work required over the course of 7 to 10 years. Most were also very green when it came to coding and building a product company.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>The only way to know their true colors is to actually start working together.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20only%20way%20to%20know%20their%20true%20colors%20is%20to%20actually%20start%20working%20together.&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2080' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next you might try going to local networking events. I recommend </span><a href="https://www.nextcanada.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next36</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where they curate a list of potential founders and matches based on preferences. Many successful startups have been born out of this organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So get your idea out. <strong>Tell people about your challenges</strong> <strong>and see if they can connect you with someone they recommend</strong>. Heck, build a small demo and show it off to developers. (You did finish level 3, right?) This will show them you understand code and that there are fun technical challenges ahead. That‚Äôs what they want to work on. Give them a little rope to pull on. Now you‚Äôve got the ball rolling.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2158 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Technical_co-founder-Tomas_working.jpg" alt="Technical co-founder - Tomas working" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Technical_co-founder-Tomas_working.jpg 1500w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Technical_co-founder-Tomas_working-300x200.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Technical_co-founder-Tomas_working-768x512.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Technical_co-founder-Tomas_working-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h1>Step 3: Sure, ‚Äúdate‚Äù one!</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point your </span><a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoiYzcyJXTAhWk5IMKHbKwDgsQFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Frelres.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqFcBqwIbEGxsvlRIxAUOXNgU7MQ&amp;bvm=bv.152174688,d.amc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relentless resourcefulness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should start paying off. You‚Äôll find yourself having intellectual conversations with developers and motivating them towards a project you‚Äôve been stewing on. (If you can‚Äôt get to this step, perhaps this isn‚Äôt the road for you.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting overly excited, here is a short and brutally honest list of things to find out early on. Keep in mind you&#8217;re effectively looking to ‚Äúmarry‚Äù this person for the years to come. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do they want to earn a salary or are they <strong>willing to work for free</strong> <strong>for a period of time</strong>?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do you share a worldview when it comes to <strong>work ethic</strong>? If you want to go all-in on business, while they want to start a family, how will that jive?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are they <strong>able to move</strong> if you got into an incubator for 3 months?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are they <strong>excellent communicators</strong>? (They need to manage a huge team when your idea scales.) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do they have a sense of <strong>design</strong>? (Ask them what websites and products they admire from a UX/UI perspective.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do they understand <strong>agile development</strong>?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Can they manage all aspects of the <strong>tech infrastructure</strong> early on?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What are their <strong>values</strong> and <strong>ambitions</strong>?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, are they <strong>reliable</strong>? This is by far the most important one. They may </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">seem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perfect, but the only way to know their true colors is to actually start working together.</span></p>
<blockquote><hr /><p><em>The best technical co-founder is a friend you have had a relationship with for some time</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20best%20technical%20co-founder%20is%20a%20friend%20you%20have%20had%20a%20relationship%20with%20for%20some%20time&amp;via=RoadmunkApp&amp;related=RoadmunkApp&amp;url=https://roadmunk.com/blog/?p=2080' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'></a><br /><hr /></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you mitigate the risk that they‚Äôll build your code base then run off to Australia because the surf waves are looking mighty high? You do a pilot project with them. Something that shows you can stick out a few weeks of late nights with mac and cheese (sharp cheddar flavor). After that, build your flagship product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, it doesn&#8217;t work out with a particular developer. That‚Äôs when a lot of people end up giving up on entrepreneurship altogether. <strong>The cycle of finding and working with a developer can take months</strong>. And when it crashes and burns, it fucking sucks.</span></p>
<h1>So what‚Äôs the best way?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s rather obvious. In my opinion, <strong>the best technical co-founder is a friend you&#8217;ve had a relationship with for some time and worked on a project with</strong>. Heck, it doesn&#8217;t even have to be software-related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Tomas in November 2008 when we were early-stage employees at a startup called </span><a href="https://miovision.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miovision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We sat next to each other, and before long we were automating complex financial revenue recognition workflows and onboarding sales and marketing into an ERP that we championed. Between him and Colin (another engineer who now works at Roadmunk), I learned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so much. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was incredibly hungry to understand how engineering teams think about problems, operate their teams, and scale software. Over countless projects, <strong>we built a mutual respect and enjoyment for solving problems together</strong>. It was on that foundation that we launched Roadmunk (btw, check out our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=technicalcofounder" target="_blank">template library</a> if you haven&#8217;t already!). ¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2137 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Latif-Tomas-Co-founders.gif" alt="Technical co-founder - Latif and Tomas GIF" width="480" height="320" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason Tomas wanted to do a startup with me came from our working experience together. We could build and launch FAST. We also shared wisdom from our domains of expertise which made it even more fun. So we knew it was our time.¬†</span></p>
<h1>No silver bullet (as Tomas would say)</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many paths to finding a technical co-founder, none of which are easy. And none of which are quick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a job in product management or at a software startup, building relationships with developers (and learning from them), applying to programs that connect smart people‚Äîthese initiatives all take a serious commitment, focus, investment in learning, and perseverance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Tomas and I worked together at a previous company, it may have looked like I ‚Äústole‚Äù him. The truth is that as startups turn into real businesses, early-stage employees want to go back to the start. <strong>Young startups are all about speed, control and luck</strong>‚Äîit‚Äôs exhilarating. And it‚Äôs why we try so damn hard to find that right person to build a business with.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That feeling of being a new hire: it‚Äôs exciting but a little freaky. Like starting at a new school with people you‚Äôve (probably) never encountered. If you‚Äôre joining a product organization, you may find yourself facing more than the regular social politics that surround a new workplace. You may wonder, ‚Äú</span><b>How the hell does this product even work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">?‚Äù Even if you learned the basics during your interview process, that question can puzzle new hires, since they often don‚Äôt have exposure to the product space.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new product is scary; it‚Äôs overwhelming. And when you‚Äôre an early startup, </span><b>your product IS the company</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know our co-founder and CEO </span><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latif Nanji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you know that </span><b>empathy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a common word in his vocabulary. (As a new hire at Roadmunk, prepare to hear that term <em>at least</em> 10 times in your first day alone.) That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs no surprise that he understands exactly how his new hires feel coming into this space. A new product is scary; it‚Äôs overwhelming. And when you‚Äôre an early startup, </span><b>your product IS the company</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ease the onboarding process, each new Roadmunk hire does¬†customer support in their first two weeks‚Äîno matter the role or department. If that sounds scary to you, imagine how new hires feel‚Ä¶ (To this day, I can still hear the ping of a new customer inquiry in my dreams.) </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we insane? </span></em></p>
<p><em>Did our users get the help they need?</em></p>
<p><em>Did our app come crashing down?! </em></p>
<p>Seeing as all our employees have gone through the process and our customers are still happy, it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôve survived. Which is why we wanted to share¬†the goldmine of positive reasons for why we&#8217;re committed to¬†this initiation phase. Here‚Äôs how it benefits our entire staff, company and ultimately, our customers.</p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where did we get this idea?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, Latif picked up the book </span><em><a href="http://deliveringhappiness.com/book/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering Happiness</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†by Zappos‚Äô CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tonyhsieh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Hseih</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The book explains how a company-wide focus on employee and customer happiness resulted in one of the fastest-growing startups in Silicon Valley. It was¬†the perfect guide for Latif‚Äôs own company vision: a vision entrenched in user and employee empathy.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>No matter your role, your job always relates to the company vision and, by extension, the customer.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key concepts Latif drew from Hseih‚Äôs book was that </span><b>customer service is the responsibility of the WHOLE company, not just one department</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No matter your role, your job always relates to the company vision and, by extension, the customer. When talking to the customer is the </span><b>first thing you do in your role</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you immediately begin to understand the people whose mission you‚Äôre serving. Without that understanding, you have a second-degree connection to the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why settle for a flimsy, second-degree connection when you can have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees really comprehend the </span><b>who</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>what</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>why </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of their user base? By putting employees on the frontline, they immediately form </span><b>emotional connections </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with users and‚Äîdare, I say it‚Äî<strong>gain empathy towards their problem.</strong></span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to implement this idea (without losing quality)</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The philosophy and intention behind having new hires do customer support is all well and good, but how do you put it into practice? To get the ball rolling, our new hires train closely with our <strong>Customer Success</strong>¬†team in their first few days.¬†Some of the things they learn include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use Roadmunk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=newhiresupport" target="_blank">customizable template library</a>¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use our customer support tool </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to directly chat with users through the platform (including learning our voice &amp; tone and canned responses to common questions)</span></li>
<li>How to use our <a href="http://support.roadmunk.com" target="_blank">Knowledge Base</a> to find answers to customer questions</li>
<li>How to handle tricky and complex customer inquiries</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to track conversations with customers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to find user information</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three central questions each employee needs to know before plunging into support:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you respond to common questions that are asked?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you do research to answer incoming questions?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you look up information about the customers?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they have absorbed all the knowledge like the sponges that they are, the new hire descends into the trenches, where they spend half of their days for the first two weeks responding to incoming user inquiries.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1440 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-nay-sayers-divider-300x160.png" alt="Frustrated face in bubble - Facing naysayers" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-nay-sayers-divider-300x160.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2-nay-sayers-divider.png 421w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to say to the nay-sayers</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of you may be shaking your head at this point and screaming, <strong>‚ÄúWon‚Äôt anybody think of the risks?!‚Äù</strong> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if they give the wrong answer? What if they cost you a customer? What if they accidentally send a GIF of an annoying mannequin challenge?¬†</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The possibilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we‚Äôre being honest, there is a risk in letting brand new employees talk to users at the very start of their stint. But to that we say: </span><strong><i>Meh</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>.</strong> We acknowledge the ‚Äòdanger,‚Äô <strong>but we have full trust in our Customer Success team and our new hires‚Äô savvy</strong>. We have a highly supportive process that ensures Customer Success is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading through cases </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewing answers by new hires </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing feedback </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking over complex situations </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Customer Success team is the rock behind the whole process, and they understand that the new employee is being </span><del><span style="font-weight: 400;">sacrificed</span></del><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thrown into something new. So while a risk may exist, you can</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">still have a</span><b> process in place that will ensure the quality of the employee‚Äôs responses </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that they receive</span><b> continuous feedback.</b></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1441 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-new-hires-divider-300x160.png" alt="Concerned face - Hesitation from new hires" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-new-hires-divider-300x160.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-new-hires-divider.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with hesitation from new hires</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naysayers don‚Äôt stop at external skeptics. How do you deal with resistance from the new employees themselves? I‚Äôm sure the last thing many recent hires want to hear when they first join is, ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre going to be doing customer support this week! Yay!‚Äù</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to users is the fastest way to learn their </span><b>most critical issues‚Äî</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and learn the nuances of your new job.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response:</span><b>¬†customer support should be seen as an opportunity, not a burden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers are busy people. They don‚Äôt have an hour to spare here and there. Speaking directly to customers and understanding their processes and goals is a huge benefit. Talking to users is the fastest way to learn their </span><b>most critical issues‚Äî</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and learn the nuances of your new job. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go through the pain with them and you‚Äôll understand it better than anyone. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe people who speak to our customers the most perform the best at their job,‚Äù says Latif. ‚ÄúI want to augment that thinking from the start, especially as a product company. Go help our users and work through the product with them. Not only do you </span><b>immediately immerse yourself in the company culture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but you will transform your mind to adjust to the product space and </span><b>align to customer thinking</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1442 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-benefit-employee-divider-300x160.png" alt="Emojis in bubbles - Benefits to employees" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-benefit-employee-divider-300x160.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/4-benefit-employee-divider.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does this benefit our employees?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know Latif is a huge proponent of this idea, but I wanted to know how my fellow colleagues <strong>felt about</strong> and <strong>benefitted from</strong> their stint in customer support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatting with our Operations Manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roxykesh" target="_blank">Roxy</a>, I found out she was a big fan of the process and gained a lot¬†from the firsthand customer contact, especially as an employee who doesn‚Äôt directly deal with clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1475 size-large aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Roxy-1024x815.png" alt="Slack conversation - Roxy" width="640" height="509" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Roxy-1024x815.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Roxy-300x239.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Roxy-768x611.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Roxy.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our developers, Feng, admitted that support was a difficult process to wrap his head around, but in the end, he saw the light. Turns out he still references support conversations to this day.<br />
</span><br />
<img class="wp-image-1476 size-large aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Feng-1024x811.png" alt="slack_feng" width="640" height="507" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Feng-1024x811.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Feng-300x238.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Feng-768x608.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Feng.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/elenideacon" target="_blank">Eleni</a>, our Marketing Director, felt more confident with her marketing decisions thanks to early exposure to user psychology. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1477 size-large" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Eleni-1024x512.png" alt="Slack conversation - Eleni" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Eleni-1024x512.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Eleni-300x150.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Eleni-768x384.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Eleni.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the process helps employees onboard faster. And yes, it helps new hires learn the product more in-depth. But the benefits extend way beyond the first two weeks:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees </span><b>refer back to previous support conversations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when developing solutions for problems that pop up further down the line.</span></li>
<li>They <b>understand the user mindset</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and apply that knowledge in their day-to-day tasks.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on my chats, the process is </span><b>an empowering experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a new hire you‚Äôre brought on for your experience. However, chances are your past experience isn‚Äôt tailored to your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new product or market. With exposure to customers early on, new hires adapt their ideas to the new market and </span><b>have more confidence in their earlier decisions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h1><img class="size-medium wp-image-1452 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-align-company-300x160.png" alt="Smiley faces in bubble - Aligning company" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-align-company-300x160.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5-align-company.png 421w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does this align our company?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We delved into why we maintain this practice on an employee level, but what about company-wide? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to our resident Product Manager, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/sameenavelshi" target="_blank">Sameena</a>, to see how¬†the practice affects cross-departmental work‚Äîsince she gets the privilege of working with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(almost).</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1478 size-large" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Sameena-1024x933.png" alt="Slack conversation - Sameena" width="640" height="583" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Sameena-1024x933.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Sameena-300x273.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Sameena-768x700.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Sameena.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-smith-a9ba4933" target="_blank">Stephanie</a>, our Customer Success Manager, deals with support on a daily basis. She has seen a more cohesive, collaborative and empathetic environment across the board. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1479 size-large" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Steph-1024x760.png" alt="Slack conversation - Stephanie" width="640" height="475" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Steph-1024x760.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Steph-300x223.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Steph-768x570.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Slack_Steph.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a </span><b>benchmark understanding of the product</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established early on, employees and departments jive and grow together much faster. (It‚Äôs that damn empathy.) Nothing is more annoying for a company than when your departments lack a cohesive understanding of your vision and product. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there‚Äôs a central understanding, you‚Äôll run a tighter, better-oiled machine.</span></i></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1453 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-help-customer-divider-300x160.png" alt="Emojis in bubbles - Benefits to customers" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-help-customer-divider-300x160.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-help-customer-divider.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, how does this help the customer?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôve already discussed how putting new hires on support benefits both our staff and our company. But there‚Äôs one major reason left to discuss: benefits for the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Our customers are the reason we do this.</strong> They‚Äôre the sun to our solar system, the peanut butter to our jelly, the cream cheese to our bagel, the&#8230; You get the point. So with employees and company culture benefitting from the customer support experience, it only means positive effects for your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By encouraging new hires to communicate directly with customers,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">companies foster a </span><b>wider pool of more knowledgeable employees from which to solicit feedback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This means more voices speaking for the customer, figuring out how to solve their problem.¬†</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Organizational and departmental trade-offs are viewed differently as decisions are made with more emphasis on the customers‚Äô needs.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the more employees speak to users, the more the company shifts towards operating from a <strong>customer success standpoint</strong>. </span>That is to say, organizational and departmental trade-offs are viewed differently as decisions are made with more emphasis on the customers‚Äô needs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, instead of solely being revenue-focused, the focus is on such things as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the users‚Äô problems (and preferences)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holistically understanding how your product fits into their life and/or work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring smooth onboarding and ongoing support</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your success relies on providing the best customer experience‚Äîwith the belief (and proof!) that revenue and growth will flow from that approach. When a customer sees a company understanding their frustrations and honing in on their best interests, it <strong>builds loyalty to your brand and your product</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned previously, experiencing a user‚Äôs pain firsthand puts you on their wavelength, which ends up being way more powerful and impactful than any other means of customer interaction. It‚Äôs what Latif calls the ‚Äúmodern way of empathy.‚Äù </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don‚Äôt need a degree‚Äîor any experience whatsoever‚Äîto get a product management internship. At least, that‚Äôs what our own intern, Youssef, wanted to prove. Youssef is 18. He just finished high school. He first connected with Roadmunk via <em>cold message</em>. And he basically started looking for internships to prove a point.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA bunch of my teachers in school said it‚Äôs impossible to get any type of good decent job, or any experience at all, without some form of degree or experience,‚Äù Youssef says, ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòI think i can.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Youssef was right. You don‚Äôt need a degree or experience to get a worthwhile gig. But you also can‚Äôt just send a standard cover letter. Although we never thought we‚Äôd hire a random teenager, Youssef proved, both during and after the recruitment process, that he could bring concrete benefits to our team. How did he do it? In Youssef‚Äôs case, it was all about being <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html" target="_blank">relentlessly resourceful</a>.</p>
<p>We thought Youssef‚Äôs story would be helpful for other aspiring PMs looking to get a foothold in the field. Youssef‚Äôs experiences (it‚Äôs a pretty cool/funny story), then outline some tips for landing your first product management internship.</p>

<h1>How Youssef met Roadmunk</h1>
<p>So. Youssef wanted to land an internship in product. He knew he wanted to get startup experience, so he researched <a href="http://dmz.ryerson.ca/" target="_blank">companies at the DMZ</a>, the incubator where Roadmunk was operating at that time. He narrowed his search down to two places, Roadmunk and <a href="https://chefhero.com/">ChefHero</a>. Then he sent us the following chat message via the support channel on our website.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1008" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat1-300x161.png" alt="product management internship_chat1" width="600" height="321" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat1-300x161.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat1-768x411.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat1.png 801w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>A few things to note about this message:</p>
<ol>
<li>It‚Äôs super short.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs lucid. The sentences are crystal-clear.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs friendly but confident.</li>
</ol>
<p>This message caught our attention. But it obviously wasn‚Äôt enough to convince our team to hire a high-school kid. Over the next few minutes, there was¬†some¬†more back-and-forth.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1018 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat4-1-300x177.png" alt="product management internship" width="600" height="354" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat4-1-300x177.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat4-1-768x453.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat4-1.png 927w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>And some skepticism‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1044" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-2youssef_chat-300x96.png" alt="Artboard 2youssef_chat" width="600" height="192" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-2youssef_chat-300x96.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-2youssef_chat-768x246.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-2youssef_chat.png 830w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Eventually <a href="http://twitter.com/jalilasaria" target="_blank">Jalil</a>, our Head of Sales, suggested turning Youssef down but letting him come to the office and hang out for a day.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1014 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat3-300x142.png" alt="product management internship" width="600" height="284" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat3-300x142.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat3-768x364.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/product-management-internship_chat3.png 845w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Now Youssef had an ‚Äúin.‚Äù Latif proposed the one-day hang‚Äî<a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/mapping-my-future/" target="_blank">which you can read about here</a>. During his day at Roadmunk, Youssef talked more about his own startup, a Canadian-made menswear business called <a href="http://philanth.ca/" target="_blank">Phil Anth</a>, and generally demonstrated that he was not only smart and willing to learn, but exceptionally resourceful.</p>
<p>(Side note: Youssef says he started Phil Anth by ‚Äúcalling a bunch of factory owners.‚Äù This is <em>mayyybe</em> not a typical 18-year-old.)</p>

<p>After that day, Latif thought he was done. But Youssef wasn‚Äôt. He kept up an email correspondence with different team members, working every available angle and continuing to show enthusiasm. He also used his connection with Roadmunk to get introductions to other key players in the local startup ecosystem, and continued using Latif as a sounding board while weighing his post-high school plans. Here&#8217;s just one of the follow-up messages he sent Latif.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1035" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-9youssef_emails-300x95.png" alt="Artboard 9youssef_emails" width="600" height="190" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-9youssef_emails-300x95.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-9youssef_emails-768x243.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-9youssef_emails.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Basically, Youssef was playing the long game. A few months after his job-shadow day, he sent another email, proposing a second¬†visit.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1037" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-10youssef_emails-300x114.png" alt="Artboard 10youssef_emails" width="600" height="229" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-10youssef_emails-300x114.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-10youssef_emails-768x293.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-10youssef_emails.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>That additional day turned into a week-long stint in our Toronto office. At this point, Youssef knew he wanted a product management internship, so he starting building a relationship with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sameenavelshi" target="_blank">Sameena</a>, our Head of Product. Five months after his initial chat message, Youssef again pitched a full-on summer gig.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1038" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-11youssef_emails-300x137.png" alt="Artboard 11youssef_emails" width="600" height="274" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-11youssef_emails-300x137.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-11youssef_emails-768x350.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-11youssef_emails.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>A few notes about this final pitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>It shoots straight. Youssef shows maturity and humility by acknowledging the challenges to hiring a newb.</li>
<li>He talks about how excited he is to learn. Twice.</li>
<li>He demonstrates that he ‚Äúgets‚Äù the startup vibe. Whether you‚Äôre pitching a startup or an enterprise, it‚Äôs important to understand their unique pressures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Youssef took a bottom-up sales approach to landing a product management internship. He was patient, and built relationships over time rather than giving up after the first letdown.</p>
<p>Latif explains it like this: ‚ÄúHe first went to our support channel, and he got to spend a day in the office. Then it was like, ‚ÄòOkay, how do I work here for a week?‚Äô He thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to bug Sameena because I want to work in product.‚Äô And then he got to work here for a week. Then he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòOkay, how do I actually land a full-on internship?‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs Youssef‚Äôs story, and it‚Äôs pretty unique‚Äîchances are you couldn‚Äôt replicate this exactly. However, there are some key takeaways from Youssef‚Äôs experience that apply to anyone seeking a foothold in product management.</p>
<h1>Landing a product management internship</h1>
<p>Regardless of your education or experience, Latif says there are basically two core skills you need to get an internship in product management.</p>
<ol>
<li>A+ communication skills</li>
<li><em>Some</em> technical competency</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few relevant insights from Youssef‚Äôs story that demonstrate how he proved his value in these two areas.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1022 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-1youssef_icons-300x300.png" alt="Asset 1youssef_icons" width="100" height="100" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-1youssef_icons-300x300.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-1youssef_icons-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-1youssef_icons.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></p>
<p><strong>Make clarity your priority.</strong> Notice how all of Youssef‚Äôs emails get straight to the point? <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-product-manager/" target="_blank">Communication is one of the most essential competencies for product managers.</a> When trying to land an internship, clarity has two benefits. It makes it a lot more likely that the person on the receiving end will actually read‚Äîand respond to‚Äîyour email. And it shows that you have the core communication skills needed to even start doing the job at a basic level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1020" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-3youssef_icons-150x150.png" alt="Asset 3youssef_icons" width="100" height="82" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-3youssef_icons-300x247.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asset-3youssef_icons.png 393w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></p>
<p><strong>Target relationships, not just internships.</strong> ‚ÄúYoussef basically worked the system,‚Äù Latif explains, ‚ÄúHe worked Sameena, he worked Jalil, and then those people said, ‚ÄòI need Youssef because he is going to add value.‚Äô‚Äù Youssef ultimately didn‚Äôt get his internship because of his emails or his entrepreneurial instincts‚Äîhe was hired because he built strong relationships with everyone on the team.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1027 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-16youssef_icons-1-300x300.png" alt="Artboard 16youssef_icons" width="100" height="100" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-16youssef_icons-1-300x300.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-16youssef_icons-1-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-16youssef_icons-1.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></p>
<p><strong>Balance confidence with willingness to learn.</strong> In Youssef‚Äôs final email to Sameena, he repeatedly stresses how excited he is to learn. But he always sounds assured, even when acknowledging the risks associated with hiring someone inexperienced. As Youssef puts it: ‚ÄúIf you show some confidence, and the fact that you‚Äôre also willing to learn, it just balances out.‚Äù</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1029 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-12youssef_icons-300x300.png" alt="Artboard 12youssef_icons" width="100" height="100" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-12youssef_icons-300x300.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-12youssef_icons-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-12youssef_icons.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></p>
<p><strong>Show some technical literacy.</strong> We know, we know: <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/how-non-technical-product-managers-can-jump-the-skills-gap/" target="_blank">being a product manager doesn‚Äôt mean knowing how to code.</a> But you do have to have a certain degree of technical proficiency. What does this mean? Youssef proved his technical mettle during his one-week residency at Roadmunk when he was assigned a topsy-turvy task in Excel. Latif says he quickly figured out what to do. ‚ÄúA lot of people will see a spreadsheet, and just think, ‚ÄòMath, high school, I‚Äôm done here.‚Äô That wasn‚Äôt the case,‚Äù Latif explains, ‚ÄúI saw the output of the work and I knew that he was technical enough.‚Äù</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1030 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-18youssef_icons-300x300.png" alt="Artboard 18youssef_icons" width="100" height="100" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-18youssef_icons-300x300.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-18youssef_icons-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Artboard-18youssef_icons.png 324w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></p>
<p><strong>Be relentlessly resourceful.</strong> Hands down, this was the key to Youssef‚Äôs ultimate success in landing a product management internship. After the initial letdown, Youssef didn‚Äôt just shrug and walk away. He kept in touch. He kept working different angles. He kept trying. And trying. And trying. Until he finally reached his desired outcome. Whether you‚Äôre trying to break into product management or you‚Äôre already on-the-job, relentless resourcefulness is crucial for building both your career‚Äîand a product.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For lots of companies, their central product is also, in a sense, their brand. Take Slack. Slack is a product. But it‚Äôs also a brand. When you hear the word Slack, you probably think of the app: the thing that sits on your desktop where you send GIFs‚Äî<em>errrr</em> important, work-related messages‚Äîall day. That‚Äôs the product. But you might just as easily think of their <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/690082427037970432">cute tweets</a>, <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/02/18/stewart-butterfield-slack-entrepreneur/">cool founder</a>, and desire to dramatically change how we communicate. Those factors speak to the brand.</p>
<p>This can be confusing, because products and brands aren‚Äôt the same thing. And product managers and brand managers don‚Äôt do the same thing. So how are these positions different‚Äîand how do they work together?</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-245 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PMBM1.png" alt="PMBM1" width="103" height="50" /></p>
<h2>Products vs. Brands</h2>
<p>To understand these two roles, we first need to understand what it is they‚Äôre actually managing. As we‚Äôve already explored, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product/">a <strong>product</strong> is a <strong>good</strong> or <strong>service</strong> offered to customers for benefits</a>. It can be a tangible or virtual item (a good), or a package of activities (a service).</p>
<p>A <strong>brand</strong>, on the other hand, is a much more abstract concept. A brand is the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of an organization. It refers to how an organization is perceived‚Äîan inevitably abstract metric. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/12/define-brand.html">As Seth Godin once put it</a>, ‚ÄúA brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer‚Äôs decision to choose one product or service over another.‚Äù</p>
<h2><img class="size-full wp-image-249 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PMBM2.png" alt="PMBM2" width="101" height="49" /></h2>
<h2>PMs vs. BMs: Their responsibilities</h2>
<p>So how do product managers and brand managers spend each day? Let‚Äôs take a look at where they funnel their energy.</p>
<p><strong>Product managers</strong> focus on the design and features of a particular product. Their work can be highly logistical and <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-product-manager/">(at least somewhat) technical</a>, involving close horizontal collaboration with executives, developers, sales and marketing. They aim to improve, upgrade and maintain fluid functioning of their product, with a strong emphasis on how customers actually interact with it and how it fits into the market. They deliver the products that people use.</p>
<p><strong>Brand managers</strong> focus on the maintenance and perception of a particular brand. Their work is often strategic, involving high-level curation of both their company‚Äôs image and the practical steps it will take to maintain that image. Brand managers often work at consumer product companies with mass-market output. They aim to enhance, maintain and inspire interest in their brand, with a strong emphasis on marketing and how their overall organization is viewed. They inspire feelings, reactions and loyalty.</p>
<h2><img class="size-full wp-image-250 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PMBM3.png" alt="PMBM3" width="101" height="49" /></h2>
<h2>Different value propositions</h2>
<p>Another way to distinguish between product managers and brand managers is to understand their divergent value propositions.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúA value proposition is a business or marketing statement that summarizes why a consumer should buy a product or use a service.‚Äù ‚ÄìInvestopedia</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Product managers</strong> create value propositions that convey tangible rewards. They build products with the goal of offering measurable value: to make you more productive, to improve communication, <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=brandvsproduct" target="_blank">to make beautiful roadmaps quickly</a>.</p>
<p><strong>https://roadmunk.com/Brand managers</strong> also create value propositions, but theirs are more intuitive. Brand managers spark perceived value‚Äîa sense that ‚Äúbuying in‚Äù to the brand will have a payoff. The nature of that payoff is more abstract. It could be something tangible (like actual, increased productivity) or it could simply be the feeling of increased productivity that the brand inspires.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-251 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PMBM4.png" alt="PMBM4" width="101" height="49" /></p>
<h2>Different pain points</h2>
<p>Different jobs, different stressors. Because <strong>product managers</strong> are responsible not just for the development, but also the ongoing health and well-being of their product, they must constantly triage and address new requests, releases and bugs. Their job is far from finished once a product is launched. And while their product may operate on a long lifecycle, they must constantly and creatively come up with new versions and upgrades that will keep their product competitive.</p>

<p><strong>Brand managers</strong>, on the other hand, typically work on shorter cycles. They are responsible for product line depth, width and extensions, and often experience more day-to-day urgency. Because it‚Äôs up to them to prevent brand obsolescence, they must constantly and creatively come up with new products that will keep the brand top-of-mind and top-of-market. Their function is much more than simply PR‚Äîthey strategize how to keep the business (and the brand) current across every channel.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-256 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PMBM5v2.png" alt="PMBM5v2" width="101" height="49" /></p>
<h2>So how do they feed each other?</h2>
<p>Guess what! Brand managers and product managers don‚Äôt operate in a vacuum. Their functions are interrelated.</p>
<p>The <strong>product manager</strong> supports‚Äîand sometimes helps create‚Äîthe brand. Product managers are responsible for consistently building and maintaining products that serve as a tangible touchpoint to that brand. <a href="https://about.me/petereconomides">As brand strategist Peter Economides says</a>, ‚ÄúEverything you say and do, and everything you don‚Äôt say and don‚Äôt do, communicates.‚Äù Products communicate, and product managers are responsible for making sure they communicate the right brand.</p>
<p>The <strong>brand manager</strong>, meanwhile, creates a mindspace for the product. Since brand managers are concerned about brand obsolescence‚Äîor rather, avoiding obsolescence‚Äîthey need to drive the introduction of new products into the marketplace. While product managers might be responsible for the upkeep of one product, brand managers cultivate the soil in which new products can grow.</p>
<p>What else differentiates product managers from brand managers? Brand managers: what role do you play in product development? Product managers: how do you speak to the brand?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A juggler, a psychologist, a firefighter, and a CEO: these are just some of the roles that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good product managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channel each day. As the connective tissue between a company‚Äôs various stakeholders, product managers need razor-sharp interpersonal instincts and the ability to align conflicting personalities, perspectives and goals. But they also need logistical acumen, since they‚Äôre responsible for putting ideas into action‚Äîand cleaning up messes. In short, their duties can be dizzying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what makes a good product manager</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyway? While pretty much </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">skill can be useful to a product manager‚Äîthat Robert De Niro impression? It will help you win friends in sales‚Äîthese 5 core capabilities form a solid foundation.</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="wp-image-109 alignnone" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-02.png" alt="commenting_icons-02" width="80" height="80" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-02.png 208w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-02-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></b>Their #1 priority is prioritizing.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do product managers have their own (way-too-long) to-do lists, they also set tasks for other teams. This means they need to understand each team‚Äôs nitty-gritty responsibilities and the company‚Äôs big-picture goals‚Äîthen establish priorities that accommodate both factors. They must be able to prioritize according to their company‚Äôs short-term concerns (‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bug!! We need to fix it now!!!‚Äù), medium-term objectives (getting that feature launch out the door), and long-term vision (total world domination?). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good product managers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize discretely, setting targets one-by-one. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great product managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set day-to-day priorities with the big-picture plan mind.</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-110" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-03.png" alt="commenting_icons-03" width="80" height="80" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-03.png 208w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-03-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></b>Their EQ matches their IQ.</h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="wp-image-148 size-full alignleft" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tinyganj.png" alt="" width="80" height="80" /></span></p>
<p><em>Great products connect with their users emotionally; product managers with a high EQ are better able to empathize with their users.</em>¬†‚Äî Latif Nanji, Roadmunk CEO</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective product managers don‚Äôt just read data‚Äîthey read people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great product managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are world-class communicators with extremely high emotional intelligence. (That‚Äôs EQ for short.) It‚Äôs not easy being the go-between to so many stakeholders. People want things. People disagree with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lots</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of things. People have deadlines and roadblocks and personal beefs. And it‚Äôs the product manager who must listen, assess and decide how to act on each consideration. Doing this well isn‚Äôt just about delegating tasks. It‚Äôs about reading the room, smoothing rough waters, and communicating with clarity, authority and understanding. To establish a <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=goodproductmanager" target="_blank">savvy roadmap</a>, product managers need an analytical mind. But without strong emotional intelligence, it‚Äôs impossible to get everyone en route.</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-121" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-06.png" alt="commenting_icons-06" width="80" height="80" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-06.png 208w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-06-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></b>They‚Äôre not just leaders‚Äîthey‚Äôre shapers.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product managers work horizontally, not vertically. They travel across an organization, aligning various teams towards a common vision. Because their work crosses so many departments, they aren‚Äôt so much top-down authorities as in-the-trenches warriors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great product managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aren‚Äôt just team leaders. (In fact, in a lot of cases product managers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren‚Äôt </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">team leaders.) They focus on shaping the vision for a product, rather than simply directing the individuals who will bring that vision to market. It‚Äôs a subtle distinction. But it‚Äôs by focusing on a product‚Äôs big picture‚Äîrather than being the boss‚Äîthat product managers make the most dramatic impact.</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-123" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-07b.png" alt="commenting_icons-07b" width="80" height="80" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-07b.png 208w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-07b-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></b>They &#8220;get&#8221; sales.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre really wondering what makes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†a good product manager</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, start wondering about your customer. Selling isn‚Äôt generally part of a product manager‚Äôs day-to-day‚Äîbut to make a product that customers will want to buy, they need to know how to sell. Stellar product managers dig deep into data to learn everything from user psychology to pricing. They know their industry inside out, and can tell you everything you‚Äôd ever want to know about their typical user‚Äîwhat they need, how they think, and what they sang in the shower this morning. </span><a href="http://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ben Horowitz put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ‚ÄúGood product managers know the market, the product, the product line, and the competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2><b><img class="alignnone wp-image-117" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-05.png" alt="commenting_icons-05" width="80" height="80" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-05.png 208w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/commenting_icons-05-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" /></b>They‚Äôre (at least somewhat) technical.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product managers don‚Äôt need to be able to write code. But they should be able to speak the technical language of their industry‚Äîand translate that language to the less technically inclined. This is where their world-class communication skills come in. At the end of any technical conversation‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about app development, SEO marketing, or budgets‚Äîa product manager should be able to craft an easy-to-understand analogy that can relay key technical concepts to any member of any team. The best product managers might never do any hands-on technical tasks‚Äîthat‚Äôs often not part of their job. But top-of-their-game product managers understand what those tasks are, how much time they take, and how they contribute to their company‚Äôs wider goals. </span></p>
