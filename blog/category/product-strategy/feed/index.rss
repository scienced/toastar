				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not the most glamorous part of a product manager’s job, tracking metrics reveal blindspots, foster stakeholder confidence and offer vital product (and organizational) health checks for PMs. However, with a seemingly endless selection of metrics, the measurement process can appear intimidating and *</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whoosh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">* just go over your head. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a SaaS company, metrics can be even more muddled for PMs. Since SaaS business models aren’t super traditional and revenue/growth is measured in recurring units, there’s a ‘special’ subset of metrics for PMs to manage. But SaaS PMs don’t only have to worry about which metrics to measure, they have to ask themselves: <strong>w</strong><strong>hen will these metrics be valuable?</strong> Remember the </span><a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? (We’ve talked about it <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/product-management-design-principles/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank">here</a> before.) Where your product falls on this model impacts which metrics you should monitor.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2952" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management-technology_adoption_model.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Technology adoption lifecycle model" width="570" height="221" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management-technology_adoption_model.png 570w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management-technology_adoption_model-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a SaaS company ourselves, we want to help. We narrowed down the list of <strong>metrics</strong> <strong>most relevant to SaaS PMs</strong>, but also explore why they’re useful, how to calculate them and when they matter most for your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the metrics we break down:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#CLV"><strong>Customer Lifetime Value</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#CAC"><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#ACV"><strong>Annual Contract Value</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="#MRR">Monthly Recurring Revenue (or Annual Recurring Revenue)</a></strong></li>
<li><a href="#churn"><strong>Churn</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#quick"><strong>Quick Ratio</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#retention"><strong>Retention</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#conversion"><strong>Conversion Rate</strong></a></li>
<li><strong><a href="#leadvelocity">Lead Velocity Rate</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="CLV">Customer Lifetime Value</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known by many terms, <strong>customer lifetime value</strong> (LTV, CLTV, CLV, total customer value) is a benchmark for determining future spending and real customer worth. LTV is literally </span><b>how much revenue a customer will bring during their time as a paying customer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This metric is helpful to SaaS PMs when deciding how much to spend on obtaining new customers, how much to dish out to keep existing customers or where to allocate resources.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>Calculations<br />
</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculating this metric can be a big feat thanks to so many variables coming into play. Let’s break down the simplest method of calculating this metric:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>How much does your average customer pay? <span style="font-weight: 400;">Use customers’ average expenditure as the starting point for your LTV.</span></b></li>
<li><strong>Next, calculate how often your average customer pays</strong>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">i.e. What is the average number of purchases you get in the same timeframe as step 1?</span></li>
<li><strong>Finally, average lifetime of your customer.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">How long does the average customer stay as a paying customer? (Note: unit of time should be consistent with steps 1 &amp; 2)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve got those three factors, plug and chug into the formula below to get LTV.<br />
</span><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2953" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_managment_metrics-CLV.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Customer lifetime value equation" width="713" height="196" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_managment_metrics-CLV.png 713w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_managment_metrics-CLV-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this formula streamlines the process, there’s a problem. The formula gives all revenue without considering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs. Let&#8217;s be real; there <em>are</em> costs involved with getting/keeping customers. If you want a more accurate LTV, consider </span><b>average profit margin per customer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and include it in the formula like so:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3041" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV-2.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - CLV equation 2" width="904" height="188" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV-2.png 904w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV-2-300x62.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV-2-768x160.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting for average profit margin addresses money spent to keep customers around during their ‘lifetime.’ While this tightens the formula, it’s still an average. It covers ALL your customers no matter who they are. To make this metric even more valuable, consider <strong>customer segments</strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a SaaS organization, you’ll probably have different tiers of customers/subscriptions, so an aggregate LTV <em>probably</em> isn&#8217;t useful. Real value pops up when you calculate LTV of your enterprise customers vs. business subscribers vs. professional users or long-time customers vs. newer customers (or any other categorization you see fit).</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2955" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV_graph.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - CLV graph" width="678" height="327" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV_graph.png 678w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CLV_graph-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no specific formula to split LTV by user segment. All you do is apply the regular LTV formula to the segmented customers you want to study. From there, identify which segments are most profitable, so you can analyze the amount you’re willing to spend to capture different types of customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, LTV only becomes relevant to SaaS PMs the longer a product is in market. Looking at the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model, your LTV is a major KPI once in the </span><b>Early Adopters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phase—just before the chasm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SaaS PMs with products in the Innovators phase should be less concerned with LTV because your metrics should still be quite high-level. Your product is still relatively new, so growth rates and revenue are the focus. You don’t know what the hell your average customer’s lifetime is! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product-market fit and metrics like LTV become vital (thanks to a better understanding of your customer base) in the Early Adopters phase. LTV influences product strategy since SaaS PMs use this metric to pinpoint which features to develop based on customer segments they want to prioritize and what product areas they’re willing to invest the team’s time/money/energy.  </span></p>

<h1 id="CAC">Customer Acquisition Cost</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Customer acquisition cost</b> (CAC) is exactly what it sounds like. <strong>How much you spend to acquire a new customer</strong>. We’re talking costs of <i>every</i> effort to convert leads to customers. Sales collateral, marketing campaign costs, automation software costs, sales &amp; marketing team salaries. Basically, all that sales &amp; marketing team budgeting? It’s included in CAC.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>Calculations</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the simplest level, you calculate CAC by taking </span><b>all costs acquiring new customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dividing it by the </span><b>number of new customers you’ve gained</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (for a specific time period). </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2956" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Customer_acquisition_cost.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Customer acquisition cost calculation" width="321" height="264" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Customer_acquisition_cost.png 321w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Customer_acquisition_cost-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the CAC calculation in its most rudimentary form. You can dive even deeper by calculating CACs for </span><b>specific campaigns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cost per clicks, SEM/SEO campaigns, free trials, etc.). Just divide the costs incurred for that campaign, by the number of customers acquired due to the campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a more granular outlook, you might determine </span><b>CAC per stage of your marketing/sales funnel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You&#8217;d calculate costs associated with each funnel stage and number of customers acquired in that corresponding stage.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?<br />
</big></strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This metric revolves around marketing and sales costs, so why should a PM care? Well, alone CAC answers the question: </span><b>are we spending too much to get customers?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tracking CAC lets a SaaS PM adjust, pivot, swerve, do whatever needs to be done to improve product strategy. By itself, CAC is a beneficial metric for a PM at any point along the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model in terms of </span><b>budgeting, planning or resource allocation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2957" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CAC_vs_CLV.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - CAC vs. CLV diagram" width="742" height="336" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CAC_vs_CLV.png 742w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-CAC_vs_CLV-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, CAC’s real power is unlocked when </span><b>combined with LTV </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">because that’s when you can truly evaluate ROI. As seen in the diagram above, if CAC is greater than LTV umm… you have a genuine problem. If CAC’s lower than LTV, congrats! Your product strategy contributes to a solid business model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure—by itself, this metric highlights spending habits. But without a comparison to LTV, it’s pretty meaningless. Combine the two and see how ROI is faring and use that comparison to offer transparency on whether or not your product strategy generates more than it costs. </span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="ACV">Annual Contract Value</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working our way down from lifetime to yearly metrics, another valuable metric is <b>annual contract value</b> (or ACV). Essentially, it’s the <strong>average annual revenue you receive per customer contract</strong>.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>Calculations</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seems to be a lot of confusion about how to calculate ACV. Should one-time fees be included? How do you handle multiple contract types? Is this the same as <a href="#MRR">annual recurring revenue (ARR)</a>? It’s a little all over the place.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We find the easiest way to calculate ACV is to </span><b>remember it is an average</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So even if you have multiple contract types, you’re finding the average monetary value of your customer contracts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, say Company X has one customer contract type of $1,200 for the year, paid in monthly increments of $100. Whether customers signed up for one year or five, the ACV is $1,200 until Company X changes that pricing. Say Company X introduces two new types of contracts: a yearly contract of $3,000 and another one for $1,500. For ACV, you take all three contract values for the year and average them. And that’s it. The formula boils down to this:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2958" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Annual contract value equation" width="337" height="96" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV.png 337w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV-300x85.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your ACV also excludes one-time fees. If you’re interested in including them, then the metric you might be looking for is </span><b>Total Contract Value (TCV)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the sum of the different contract values for a year, plus any additional one-time fees. Revisiting Company X, if we want Company X’s TCV for the year, add the values ($1,200 + $3,000 + $1,500) plus any additional one-time fees associated with each contract.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACV is one of those metrics you can calculate any time as a SaaS PM. I mean, you probably aren’t putting out a product into the market without some sort of pricing, so it should be something you can calculate—whether your product is new to the market or is being adopted by Laggards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACV is similar to CAC in the sense that it’s not very useful by itself, but </span><b>when combined with other metrics it becomes insightful data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you haven’t crossed the chasm, use ACV to measure sales and revenue (ACV multiplied by number of customers = sales data).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your product extends into the market, <strong>compare ACV against CAC</strong>. You can evaluate if your chosen price points will actually pay off costs of acquiring customers. Knowing how ACV compares to costs will impact SaaS PM’s decisions on resource allocation and product pricing.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2959" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV_vs_CAC.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - ACV vs. CAC diagram" width="588" height="386" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV_vs_CAC.png 588w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-ACV_vs_CAC-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="MRR">Monthly Recurring Revenue (or Annual Recurring Revenue)</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key differentiator between SaaS businesses and traditional software product orgs, is the fact that revenue doesn’t come in one-off purchases. Revenue comes in recurring increments on a monthly or annual basis. <strong>Monthly recurring revenue</strong> (MRR) or <strong>annual recurring revenue</strong> (ARR) are the metrics meant to track these recurring revenue streams.</span></p>
<p><strong><big>Calculations<br />
</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a bunch of MRR calculations. The most common method though is summing all customer revenue for the month.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2960" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Monthly_recurring_revenue.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Monthly recurring revenue equation" width="381" height="132" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Monthly_recurring_revenue.png 381w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Monthly_recurring_revenue-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this equation can be tedious if you&#8217;ve got many, many customers. An alternative way of calculating is to use </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">another</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> common metric: </span><b>average revenue per user</b><strong>/account</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> </strong>(or ARPU/ARPA). If you have the ARPU/ARPA for the month you can multiply that value by total number of customers to generate an average MRR.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2961" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_2.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Monthly recurring revenue 2" width="359" height="145" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_2.png 359w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_2-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people would argue though that this doesn’t calculate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">true </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRR. True MRR considers <strong>ALL monthly recurring revenue</strong> including any charges per user, upgrades, downgrades, lost MRR, etc. What you should definitely NOT include are one-time fees, because, well, that defeats the purpose of calculating a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">recurring </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">metric. This formula below includes all recurring elements:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2962" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_3.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Monthly recurring revenue 3" width="852" height="54" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_3.png 852w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_3-300x19.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_3-768x49.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To clarify the equation, let’s define these various MRR metrics that are involved:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New MRR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRR gained from new customers</span></li>
<li><b>Expansion MRR: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional MRR gained from existing customers who upgrade</span></li>
<li><b>Churned MRR: <span style="font-weight: 400;">MRR that is lost due to churn or customer downgrades</span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the formula above will give you the ‘true’ MRR of your organization. If you&#8217;re looking for new MRR earned this month (i.e. </span><b>Net New MRR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), eliminate MRR at the beginning of the month and use the formula below:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2963" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_4.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Net new MRR" width="584" height="54" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_4.png 584w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_4-300x28.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything we’ve said about MRR, applies to ARR as well. They’re calculated exactly the same way just for different time periods. If you’re measuring in monthly increments and want to analyze annually, all you’d have to do is <strong>multiply MRR amounts by 12</strong> to get ARR.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2964" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - MRR graph" width="417" height="343" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph.png 417w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p><strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing as MRR and ARR are telling signs for whether or not your SaaS organization is generating revenue, these metrics should be on a SaaS PMs radar</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at all times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If there are any metrics a SaaS PM should be monitoring when entering the product market, they should be MRR and ARR. These metrics are glimpses into how your product is selling.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2965" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph_2.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - MRR graph 2" width="897" height="419" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph_2.png 897w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph_2-300x140.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-MRR_graph_2-768x359.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you move along the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model, MRR and ARR evolve into a SaaS organization’s <strong>primary indicators for growth</strong>. SaaS PMs can develop certain product features and experiences using MRR/ARR (specifically fighting churned MRR/ARR) as justification for these decisions. </span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="churn">Churn</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, </span><b>churn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><b>customers you’ve lost in a specific period of time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tracking this metric forces you as a PM to re-evaluate your product strategy (and possibly do a reset). If churn is high, something about your product is turning away users. Consider it a healthy dose of reality about what you as a PM are doing right or wrong.<br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>Calculations<br />
</big></strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are apparently </span><a href="http://blog.profitwell.com/the-complete-saas-guide-to-calculating-churn-rate-and-keeping-it-simple" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">43 different ways to calculate churn rate for SaaS companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s a lot. But at the root of all 43 ways, churn rate is </span><b>lost customers divided by total number of customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <em>But </em>that’s if you asked for a churn rate for your company’s entire lifespan. That’s not really valuable to anyone. Hone in on a specific period and look specifically at how customers churn during that particular time.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2966" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Churn.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Churn equation" width="267" height="307" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Churn.png 267w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Churn-261x300.png 261w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should note that we’ve been talking about </span><b>customer churn rate </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">so far (a.k.a. logo churn rate). But we can also measure churn in the form of lost revenue too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><b>gross revenue churn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This metric measures how much revenue is lost in a specific period of time due to customers opting out of your product or service. Offering the same outlook as your customer churn rate, gross revenue churn puts the metric into a financial perspective for anyone who loves dealing with dollah, dollah bills instead of customer numbers. You calculate it exactly the same way as your customer churn, except replace number of customers with revenue:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2967" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Gross_revenue_churn.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Gross revenue churn equation" width="474" height="231" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Gross_revenue_churn.png 474w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Gross_revenue_churn-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where your product falls in the Adoption Lifecycle, if customers are leaving, that’s something you need to monitor. Chances are churn will become a real issue once you’ve entered the <strong>Early Adopters</strong> phase. That’s when you’ve developed a solid audience and you’re trying to reach that majority audience by crossing the chasm. As PMs, if you’re seeing your customers churning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the chasm, your chances of making it across that chasm to the majority are slim to none.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your early adopters are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">much</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more forgiving than your majority audiences because they’ve opted into a product they know is less developed and potentially buggy. So if you piss off your early adopters enough that they drop your product, you’ll experience greater pushback with your majority audiences. As a SaaS PM, make churn a primary concern once your early adopters start to ramp up and always keep an eye on the churn rate while moving further into the market. </span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="quick">Quick Ratio</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without using accounting jargon, </span><b>quick ratio</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compares </span><b>how many dollars are coming in versus how many dollars are going out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By compacting several metrics into a single ratio, quick ratio is a no-nonsense reflection of company growth and team performance—including the product team.</span></p>
<p><strong><big>Calculations<br />
</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In layman’s terms, quick ratio is <strong>revenue growth over revenue loss</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2968" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Quick_ratio.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Quick ratio equation" width="236" height="218" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be more PM-friendly, we can break that formula down further into </span><b>MRR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (monthly recurring revenue) metrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate revenue growth by summing your </span><b>new MRR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>expansion MRR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, revenue loss totals your </span><b>churned MRR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>contraction MRR </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(lost revenue due to downgrades in your time period). So the previous formula gets updated like so:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2969" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Quick_ratio_2.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Quick ratio 2" width="402" height="156" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Quick_ratio_2.png 402w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Quick_ratio_2-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end you’ll have a single number to make a ton of conclusions from. Looking at the quick ratios of the SaaS industry, we’ve got some advice for what ratio you want:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quick Ratio &gt; 4</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Our CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifnanji/" target="_blank">Latif</a>, sees this value as the gold star standard. He describes companies with a quick ratio of 4 as world-class companies because it means for every $4 of revenue, only $1 is lost (i.e. you’re growing substantially).</span></li>
<li><b>3 &lt; Quick Ratio &lt; 4: <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the range most companies fall within. It’s common to be within this range, especially if you’re before the chasm. It demonstrates good growth, but also indicates room for improvement (your costs might be too high!). </span></b></li>
<li><b>Quick Ratio &lt; 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struggling. Anything lower and you’ve got a major issue. Falling in this range suggests that churn is heavy and it’s time to rethink your product strategy. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick ratio isn’t called quick for nothing. With one glance you get a much-needed reality check on the performance of your product (and company). </span></p>
<p><strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick ratio can be calculated at any stage along the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model. If SaaS PMs are most concerned with growth and high-level statistics at your product’s earlier stages, it makes sense to throw quick ratio into the mix early on because it’s a <strong>high-level overview of your product based on growth metrics</strong>. But as discussed earlier, churn is usually not a huge concern until the Early Adopters phase. So while quick ratio can be calculated earlier, it might not be as relevant until churn becomes a larger concern. </span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="retention">Retention</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we talked about lost customers, we need to talk about loyal customers. </span><b>Retention rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—<strong>how many existing customers stay as customers</strong>—is an indicator of product management success and a presence of solid services that keep customers around. Comparing retention rate to churn rate can offer a fresh perspective on how many customers are sticking around vs. saying their goodbyes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>Calculations</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of retention rate as the antithesis of churn rate. With churn rate you calculate the rate of lost customers, whereas with retention, you calculate the opposite: </span><b>how many customers stayed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you measure the percentage of lost customers for churn, you’re measuring </span><b>the percentage of kept customers </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">for retention. Ultimately, the formulae end up being very similar.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2970" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Retention.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Retention rate equation" width="572" height="339" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Retention.png 572w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Retention-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of retention rate as a success barometer for product initiatives or strategies that have been put in place. Once you know what’s working and not, you can move forward with a stronger idea of what features are sticking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we’re dealing with the “opposite” of the churn rate here, it makes sense to start measuring your retention rate around the same time. As mentioned in our discussion of churn rate, measuring metrics related to your customers don’t become super relevant until you’ve entered the <strong>Early Adopters</strong> phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s when you’re crossing the chasm, knowing how your customers are reacting to your product becomes really important. Retention rate, however, becomes a major KPI as you </span><b>enter your majority audiences.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s in these phases when the audience is the least forgiving. If you’ve crossed over the chasm and you’re finding receptive audiences </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">choosing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay with your product, you might just have a winning product strategy on your hands. </span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="conversion">Conversion Rate</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we’re talking about metrics that measure success, let’s talk </span><b>conversion rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s the rate at which you turn a “maybe” or a straight-up “no” into a “yes.” Conversions occur throughout the marketing/sales funnel (as we see in the diagram below). For SaaS PMs’ sakes, let’s chat visitor to customer (free trial or paid) conversion rates.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3039" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Funnel.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Conversion funnel" width="646" height="410" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Funnel.png 646w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Funnel-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" />Just like retention, conversion rates are temperature checks of <strong>how successful your product strategy is</strong> and <strong>how well your</strong> <strong>product strategy aligns with product marketing and demand generation</strong>. A high conversion rate is a green light to your current product strategy, but also a benchmark for future improvements. Low conversion rates uncover flaws and a need for rejigging of your strategy.</p>
<p><strong><big>Calculations</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For whatever your desired action (in a SaaS PM’s case, a conversion from visitor to customer), you take </span><b>number of customers that completed that action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and divide by </span><b>number of “visitors” to that action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and voila—you’ve got yourself a conversion rate. (Always remember to make sure you&#8217;re choosing a consistent time range for your calculation.)</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2972" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Conversion.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Conversion rate equation" width="574" height="179" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Conversion.png 574w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Conversion-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversion rates are also relative. Yes, there may be industry standards for what a good conversion rate is. But as a PM you have a say in what’s considered successful. Think of conversion rate as a way of quantifying the efforts your team has put into capturing customers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales and growth rates are the most important metrics for SaaS PMs with products just entering the market. And conversion rates perfectly fit into that data mould. Conversion rate is the type of high-level growth data that PMs with <strong>a new product in market are most interested in</strong> (i.e. products in the Innovators and Early Adopters phases). Focus on conversions from the start of your product’s journey and beyond to consistently study whether your product (and product marketing) is hitting the mark with your audiences.</span></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="leadvelocity">Lead Velocity Rate</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, measuring MRR/ARR is great for monitoring growth and all, but the issue is that those metrics are lagging indicators. Any revenue metric you’re measuring for SaaS is based on past data—not real-time data. That’s where </span><b>lead velocity rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (LVR) steps in. LVR is <strong>your organization’s growth in terms of qualified leads</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While MRR/ARR tell you how you’ve grown, they’re pretty crappy at forecasting the future; lead velocity is </span><b>real-time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it’s a reliable predictor for future revenue and growth. The key though: </span><b>measure only </b><b><i>qualified </i></b><b>leads</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong><big>Calculations<br />
</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To calculate lead velocity, you enlist your basic growth formula, with qualified leads as your input. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2973" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Lead_velocity_rate.png" alt="SaaS product management metrics - Lead velocity rate equation" width="821" height="356" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Lead_velocity_rate.png 821w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Lead_velocity_rate-300x130.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SaaS_product_management_metrics-Lead_velocity_rate-768x333.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this formula you’ll get a percentage of your qualified lead growth month over month (or whatever time period you’re measuring). This number is a snapshot of whether your leads are growing or declining, allowing SaaS PMs to plan accordingly to capture (or maintain) leads. </span></p>
<p><strong><big>When is this metric useful for SaaS PMs?</big></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LVR is extremely relevant in the <strong>Innovators</strong> or <strong>Early Adopters</strong> phases. Since it’s a real-time indicator of growth, PMs can confidently guesstimate revenue for future stages (and adjust their product strategy based on this forecasting).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides being able to predict future revenue more accurately, a SaaS PM can take <strong>immediate action regarding product strategy and/or product marketing</strong> if they see significant changes in LVR. Because the metric is real-time, a shift could signal that features being released aren’t sticky enough or that product marketing campaigns aren’t all that they’re cracked-up-to-be. Either way, a PM can adjust their strategy immediately by being on top of this metric.</span></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>About 50% of all design firms sold in the last ten years were acquired in the last 24 months.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And they weren’t bought by Amazon or Facebook or Google. They were bought by the banks and consulting firms—the BIG financial institutions. These organizations don’t have the most innovative reputations (after all, they’re referred to as “</span><a href="http://www.ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laggards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), so when even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">these companies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are adopting design firms it says something drastic. It says: </span><b>design should be a product priority.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Design is a specialized skill, and as a PM, it can be intimidating—especially if it’s not your natural inclination.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having spent most of my career as a product manager, I’ve stated clearly—and to a lot of pushback—that </span><b>design should always be a priority for product managers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Design is a specialized skill, and as a PM, it can be intimidating—especially if it’s not your natural inclination. (Plus, there’s usually a design team to deal with that stuff, right?) But that mentality is a missed opportunity; it’s equally important for PMs to keep design top-of-mind when making decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product design was one of our key differentiators when we founded Roadmunk. </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/poker-product-management/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I’ve previously written about</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we didn’t necessarily have the data to back up that decision at the time. But look at these new statistics and tell me design isn’t rising in importance.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1642 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Design_blog-Metrics.png" alt="Product management design statistics" width="717" height="771" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Design_blog-Metrics.png 717w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Design_blog-Metrics-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laggards are waking up and savvy PMs are </span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/8-product-managers-share-trends-goals-2017/#matt" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talking about how crucial design has become to the product development process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now it’s time to integrate some concrete methods for bringing design more deeply into the PM process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are </span><b>seven product design principles that I believe all product managers should follow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Blending my first-hand experience and observations, these are the essential design principles that I think </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product manager must internalize and evangelize—especially if design is not your forté.</span></p>
<h1>1. Tell users what to think</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This first principle is an </span><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/don-t-make-me-think-key-learning-points-for-ux-design-for-the-web" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evolutionary design concept from engineer Steve Krug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It states that when designing, </span><b>we should listen to our users’ needs to the point that </b><b><i>we know and tell them what they should be thinking</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you should understand your users’ workflow so much so that you can determine what they’re attempting to do. (Like an *actually* perceptive fortune teller!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This example might help you visualize what I mean. Below, you’ll see flight search engine </span><a href="https://www.kayak.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s really well-designed, simple and easy to use. The problem, though: </span><b>I’m not sure where exactly to focus.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1622 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kayak.jpg" alt="Kayak UI" width="1154" height="758" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kayak.jpg 1154w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kayak-300x197.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kayak-768x504.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kayak-1024x673.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the UI is fantastic (the important things stand out, like the calls to actions and filters), I can’t confidently say the same for the user experience—which is just as critical as the UI. I see way too much competition between the various colors, equal priority given to all the filters, multiple lines of information in each section&#8230; It’s a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.google.com/flights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Flights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On an aesthetic level it doesn’t compare to the best websites you’ve ever seen—let alone Kayak—but they’ve done a really important thing: </span><b>they’ve established the priority in which they want you to think about things</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1623 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Google-Flights.png" alt="Google Flights UI" width="706" height="667" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Google-Flights.png 706w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Google-Flights-300x283.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like nonstop flights? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bam! There they are at the top of the list. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price is a big influencer for you? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome—here are the lower prices first. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airlines and WiFi are deal breakers? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, here’s that information upfront. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve taken into account what they already know about their users and told them, </span><b>“This is what we know you want.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Flights is </span><b>showing what matters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’ve reduced the clutter by honing in on the key user needs and hiding/putting aside the other features. The filters are all still there; they’re just greyed out or lightened to improve the user experience. This to me is a great example of a company knowing their users and empathizing with them thoughtfully.</span></p>

<h1>2. Minimize cognitive load</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A basic but easily overlooked concept is that a user experience should be simple; </span><b>your design should make the user think </b><b><i>as little as possible</i></b><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s got too much cognitive load” is probably a phrase you’ve heard from almost </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every product designer ever</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but the term cognitive load has become a keeper in the PM and design space. It’s a fancy way to say “cut the clutter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take the below example of an early version of the password program </span><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LastPass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I use this program all the time for its super-practical functionality, but looking at this early design, I’m overwhelmed for many reasons. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no focal point. Where the hell do I even start? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">button has the same degree of importance. Since when do edit, share and delete have the same weight as a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">user manual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The icon colours don’t match at all. Like at all.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1624 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Last-Pass-old-version.png" alt="Last Pass' old UI" width="952" height="474" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Last-Pass-old-version.png 952w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Last-Pass-old-version-300x149.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Last-Pass-old-version-768x382.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this version to the site’s latest design and you’ll notice a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">huge</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improvement. They’ve </span><b>designed for the user’s core action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of searching for a program-specific password to change, edit or delete. So that means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand logos were expanded and put front and center</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hover effect was added to each brand for the secondary options (edit, delete, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1625 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LastPass-New-Version.png" alt="Last Pass' new UI" width="1423" height="694" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LastPass-New-Version.png 1423w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LastPass-New-Version-300x146.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LastPass-New-Version-768x375.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LastPass-New-Version-1024x499.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1423px) 100vw, 1423px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the design may look significantly different, it was fueled by simple tweaks that drastically reduced the thinking on the user’s part and provided a </span><b>cleaner emotional experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h1>3. Three-click mentality</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple exercise for you. Pick a website or app you love and see how many clicks it takes to get to a core action. Users don’t want to click on endless buttons to reach their destination; they want short and sweet. One core design principle PMs should internalize is that </span><b>every single core action should be achievable within 3 clicks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Granted, not every application can do this, but this is a great opportunity to challenge yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a huge site. Imagine I bought something, I really love it, and now I want to tell the seller how I feel. How many clicks would it take to complete that task?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s see!</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Your Account’ would be the natural first step to view past purchases. I hover over it—which we’ll consider half a click.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1628 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-1.png" alt="Step 1 of Writing a Product Review on Amazon" width="406" height="353" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-1.png 406w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-1-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on ‘Your Orders.’</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1629 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-2.png" alt="Step 2 of Writing a Product Review on Amazon" width="406" height="353" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-2.png 406w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step-2-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down the list and click on “Write a product review.”</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1630 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step3.jpg" alt="Step 3 of Writing a Product Review on Amazon" width="1921" height="925" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step3.jpg 1921w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step3-300x144.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step3-768x370.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Step3-1024x493.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1921px) 100vw, 1921px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done. In 2.5 clicks I’ve reached my destination and can perform my core action. Despite being one of the biggest websites in the world, Amazon has taken into serious consideration how to streamline my user process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, I understand this isn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible, but I think the 3-click mentality can serve as </span><b>a litmus test to see how friendly your application really is</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h1>4. Reversible design</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all make mistakes—which is why product people designed the Undo button. Users can get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pissed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they can’t undo an action (I’ve been there!). Yet so many of the products in market still don’t offer reversible options for certain actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reversible design is more than simply clicking an undo button. Here are some examples of reversible designs from the tools I use every day:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little ‘x’ that lets me delete a filter on <a href="https://www.intercom.com/" target="_blank">Intercom</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1634 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Intercom.png" alt="Deleting filters on Intercom" width="258" height="532" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Intercom.png 258w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Intercom-145x300.png 145w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deleting or removing files from <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1635 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Google-Drive.png" alt="Undoing a file deletion in Google Drive" width="860" height="579" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Google-Drive.png 860w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Google-Drive-300x202.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Google-Drive-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving a <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> card—then being able to drag it back to its original place</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1636 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Trello.png" alt="Moving a Trello card" width="566" height="184" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Trello.png 566w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reversible-Design-Trello-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your support center is frequently inundated by questions from users who have lost files or accidentally changed work they didn’t actually want to change, you’re probably going to want to give them a way to backtrack. Where would we be without Command+Z?</span></p>
<h1>5. Use verbs with context</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your dialogue boxes are bogged down with words like </span><b>Yes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <strong>No</strong>, </span><b>Cancel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Save</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your users might be a little muddled. This vague terminology only increases cognitive load. Half the time you’re not sure you’re taking the right action, prolonging a process that should have taken little thought and even less time.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1644 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-1.png" alt="Dialogue box example" width="454" height="229" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-1.png 454w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-1-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skilled designers have now narrowed down the options and provided </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">context</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of a bevy of vague button choices, you get specific instructions: verbs/phrases like </span><b>Cancel</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><b>Yes, delete this message</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Simple. And on top of that, you get context telling you why these verbs are here (e.g. deleting the highlighted message). </span><b>Already you’ve reduced ambiguity and cognitive load.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1645 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-2.png" alt="Dialogue Box Example" width="561" height="232" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-2.png 561w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dialogue-Box-Example-2-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it really comes down to something as easy as changing the text on the screen to significantly improve a user’s experience. </span></p>
<h1>6. White space is your friend (a.k.a. Use white space to disrupt your competitors)</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dead-simple design principle can elevate your design from clunky to slick. When done well, it really </span><b>eases the emotional experience for users</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Designers tout this principle </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there is still often a struggle to integrate the concept of white space.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Yes, everything you see on this screen is something you’ll need to use at some point in the blogging process. But when you’re actually writing (i.e. performing the software’s core activity), this UI is very disruptive. It comes off as heavy and messy. Only 25% of the real estate is allocated to the white space for writing. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1637 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wordpress.png" alt="Wordpress UI" width="1420" height="812" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wordpress.png 1420w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wordpress-300x172.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wordpress-768x439.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wordpress-1024x586.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1420px) 100vw, 1420px" /></p>
<p>The site has caught on to this criticism by providing a &#8220;Distraction-free writing mode&#8221; (the small button at the far right of the text editing toolbar) in their latest versions. Temporarily removing all the sidebars, this mode puts the writing space/white space as the central focus of the page.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare this to <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>, which has always been pretty much just white space. It provides a space to write your post, then add social widgets, type some tags and publish. Essentially they’ve made the process much easier for someone who might be jarred by WordPress or similar publishing platforms. And it hasn’t reduced functionality!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1638 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Medium.png" alt="Medium UI" width="1047" height="532" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Medium.png 1047w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Medium-300x152.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Medium-768x390.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Medium-1024x520.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1047px) 100vw, 1047px" /></p>
<h1>7. Design in MSP (Minimum Saleable Product)</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, I’ve mentioned common design principles you’ll hear as a PM, but a less-talked-about principle is having your team design in </span><b>MSP (minimum saleable product)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stay away from language like MVP (minimum viable product)—unless it’s an infrastructure-related product—because to me that ignores user experience. It puts it as this far-off goal&#8230;a “nice-to-have” rather than a “must-have.”<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the image below. The pyramid on the left shows that designing in MVP starts from the bottom (i.e. the pink) and works its way up the pyramid addressing emotional design as the last “need” of the product. Whereas on the right, you see that designing in MSP tackles all the “needs” in the pyramid—including emotional design—simultaneously from the start (i.e. why the pink component covers the entire height of the pyramid).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVPs encourage teams to get something out there that is functional. It can break, but as long as the functionality and workflow are available, it’s solid. That, to me, is a “no.” What about the </span><b>usability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Or </span><b>emotional connection</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about any product you’ve ever encountered. When you first enter an application or product, you have an emotional reaction based on the design alone, which either does or does not spur you to click around and see if it’s usable. A product&#8217;s design is<strong> the </strong></span><strong>first thing a user acknowledges before anything else; </strong>it&#8217;s the first impression.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A product&#8217;s design is<strong> the </strong></span><strong>first thing a user acknowledges before anything else; </strong>it&#8217;s the first impression.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the product needs to be functional, but my sales team also needs to be able to sell to users. And not just to the early adopters and innovators: we need to sell this to the early majority. If these terms are unfamiliar, check out the </span><b>Technology Adoption Lifecycle Model </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">below. The model includes five stages of how a product gets adopted and the different customer segments within each stage. (</span><a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/create-product-roadmap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More detail on those segments here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his hugely popular 1991 book </span><b><i>Crossing the Chasm</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, author </span><b>Geoffrey Moore</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explained that for products to be successful, they must cross a </span><b>chasm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that exists between early adopters and the majority of the market.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1641 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Product_management_design-Crossing_the_Chasm.png" alt="Crossing the Chasm diagram" width="1192" height="567" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Product_management_design-Crossing_the_Chasm.png 1192w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Product_management_design-Crossing_the_Chasm-300x143.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Product_management_design-Crossing_the_Chasm-768x365.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Product_management_design-Crossing_the_Chasm-1024x487.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossing the chasm is difficult, since the early majority is vastly different (i.e. pickier) than the first two groups, who are more willing to put up with bugs and reliability issues. </span><b>The way we cross the chasm is through designing an MSP. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How? Because pickier audiences in the early majority will overlook faults that may exist when you offer a product with superior design elements.  </span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8230;the more you focus on packaging saleable features with compelling, user-friendly design, the more disruptive you can be to the market</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take my team at Roadmunk, which focuses on UX and users’ emotional responses. We find that our users aren’t gathering their pitchforks and starting a manhunt when there&#8217;s an issue, because we’ve designed in MSP to ensure that our app is kinda really pretty (#shamelessselfpromotion). Don’t get me wrong, functionality is still key, but </span><b>the more you focus on packaging saleable features with compelling, user-friendly design, the more disruptive you can be to the market</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=design" target="_blank">customizable template library</a> is one such saleable functionality that&#8217;s hit the mark with our users largely due to its user-friendliness and design focus. </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final words: Let design be your secret weapon</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design has become more and more of a priority at product organizations, and it can be your secret weapon for standing out in a sea of competitors and changing the market. It doesn’t matter whether you’re working with your first prototype or the thousandth iteration of your product, </span><b>your product’s design should always be on your mind.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t just leave design in the hands of your design team; PMs should be living and breathing it, too. Take the time to put design at the forefront of your product strategy and see how your users become emotionally invested. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prioritization is a top concern for most Product Managers.</strong> It’s by far one of the most popular topics on PM blogs, Q&amp;A sites and other online communities.</p>
<p>Although it’s not <em><strong>what we are hired to do</strong></em>, it’s <strong>something <em>that we have to do</em></strong> to achieve our real goal: creating successful products that bring value to our customers and to the business.</p>
<p>The need to prioritize comes from a very simple fact: we just <strong>don’t have enough resources to <a href="http://www.mironov.com/4laws1/" target="_blank">work on everything we can come up with.</a></strong></p>
<p>Thus, we need a process to determine the sets (and sequence) of things that should be done on the product to deliver the most value at each point in time, given our constraints.</p>
<p>If we break this statement down, a core group of questions then need to be answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we know what’s valuable? How valuable is it? Valuable to whom?</li>
<li>How can we define the set of things that should go together in a product release? How should we sequence those releases?</li>
<li>How can we get the necessary buy-in to follow through and get these things to the market?</li>
<li>How can we know if our assumptions are right? Are we on the right track? Are we really delivering value? Could we do any better?</li>
</ul>

<h1>What this guide is all about</h1>
<p>If you search around, you’ll find countless articles with recommendations, techniques and approaches to this very hard problem. However, each method’s usefulness will depend on the specific product or project where it’s applied. Your prioritization needs may vary vastly.</p>
<p>Here’s what you will get from this guide covering popular product prioritization techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A map, in the form of a <em>Periodic Table</em></strong> to help you make sense of what each technique has to offer;</li>
<li><strong>An overview of each method</strong>, with graphics and links to more in-depth resources;</li>
<li><strong>5 commonalities and takeaways from all these methods.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Periodic Table of Product Prioritization Techniques</h2>
<p>When I started working on this guide, I immediately felt the need to visually organize all of these techniques in a way that made sense and showed the context in which each of them is valuable.</p>
<p>With this mind, I found two dimensions that fulfilled these requirements and the result was the sort of <strong>Periodic Table</strong> you see below.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1280 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Priority_periodic-table-2-283x300.png" alt="Priority_periodic table 2" width="600" height="637" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Priority_periodic-table-2-283x300.png 283w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Priority_periodic-table-2.png 690w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>A full version of this guide is available at my website, <strong><a href="http://foldingburritos.com/" target="_blank">Folding Burritos</a></strong>, which includes descriptions of all 20 techniques included in the table. For this post, I have selected the 9 methods I use most frequently:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#kano">The Kano Model</a></li>
<li><a href="#buyafeature">Buy a Feature</a></li>
<li><a href="#storymapping">Story Mapping</a></li>
<li><a href="#prunethetree">Prune the Product Tree</a></li>
<li><a href="#scorecard">Scorecard</a></li>
<li><a href="#kjmethod">KJ Method</a></li>
<li><a href="#valuevscost">Value vs. Cost</a></li>
<li><a href="#featurebuckets">Feature Buckets</a></li>
<li><a href="#ianmcallister">Ian McAllister&#8217;s Framework</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The horizontal axis tracks <strong>how oriented a method is towards getting input from the inside or the outside world.</strong> In other words, how much it depends on data and opinions from people external to the core product development team.</p>
<p>This dimension reflects the fact that sometimes you need involvement from the outside (e.g. end customers or stakeholders within the company) to help you prioritize. However, in other cases you might want to follow a simpler process with the development team or by yourself.</p>
<p>The vertical axis shows <strong>how quantitative is the method prescribed by each technique.</strong> That is, how much of it is based on expert (personal) opinions instead of some kind of metric, classification, voting or ranking.</p>
<p>Some people feel more comfortable around quantitative approaches and being supported by numbers (either for themselves or for people “higher-up”). In other instances, you need to work on the qualitative side if what you’re trying to achieve is not quantifiable or if it doesn’t make sense in your context.</p>
<p>Every technique was placed in the table taking into consideration what I believe to be their relative positions along these two dimensions. Individual locations might be debatable, but I think this is a good starting point to navigate them.</p>
<p>The next section presents an overview of each technique, including pointers to other relevant and in-depth resources.</p>
<h1 id="kano">The Kano Model</h1>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriaki_Kano" target="_blank">Noriaki Kano</a>, a Japanese researcher and consultant, published a paper in 1984 with a set of ideas and techniques that help us determine our customers’ (and prospects’) satisfaction with product features. These ideas are commonly called the Kano Model and are based upon the following premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers’ satisfaction with our product’s features depends on the level of functionality that is provided (how much or how well they’re implemented);</li>
<li>Features can be classified into four categories;</li>
<li>You can determine how customers feel about a feature through a questionnaire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Satisfaction vs. Functionality</strong></p>
<p>Kano proposes two dimensions to represent how customers feel about our products:</p>
<ul>
<li>one that goes from total satisfaction (also called Delight and Excitement) to total dissatisfaction (or Frustration);</li>
<li>and another called Investment, Sophistication or Implementation, which represents how much of a given feature the customer gets, how well we’ve implemented it, or how much we’ve invested in its development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. The Four Categories of Features</strong><br />
Features can fall into four categories, depending on how customers react to the provided level of Functionality.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1253 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FullKanoModel.png" alt="The Four Categories of Features in the Kano Model" width="393" height="393" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FullKanoModel.png 393w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FullKanoModel-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FullKanoModel-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong><br />
Some product features behave as what we might intuitively think that Satisfaction works: the more we provide, the more satisfied our customers become.</li>
<li><strong>Must-be</strong><br />
Other product features are simply expected by customers. If the product doesn’t have them, it will be considered to be incomplete or just plain bad. This type of features is usually called Must-be or Basic Expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Attractive</strong><br />
There are unexpected features which, when presented, cause a positive reaction. These are usually called Attractive, Exciters or Delighters.</li>
<li><strong>Indifferent</strong><br />
Naturally, there are also features towards which we feel indifferent. Those which their presence (or absence) doesn’t make a real difference in our reaction towards the product.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Determining how customers feel through a questionnaire</strong><br />
In order to uncover our customer’s perceptions towards the product’s attributes, we need to use <strong>the Kano questionnaire</strong>. It consists of a pair of questions for each feature we want to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>One asks our customers how they feel if they have the feature;</li>
<li>The other asks how they feel if they did not have the feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and second questions are respectively called the functional and dysfunctional forms. To each “how do you feel if you had / did not have this feature,” the possible answers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like it</li>
<li>I expect it</li>
<li>I am neutral</li>
<li>I can tolerate it</li>
<li>I dislike it</li>
</ul>
<p>For each answer-pair, we use this table to determine the category where the respondents falls, letting us know how he or she feels about the feature.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1254" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/EvalTable-Mod-300x166.png" alt="Scoring table for Kano question pairs" width="600" height="333" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/EvalTable-Mod-300x166.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/EvalTable-Mod.png 656w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>From the individual responses and resulting categories you can go into two levels of analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discrete:</strong> each answer-pair is classified using the table above and feature’s category will be the most frequent across all respondents;</li>
<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> each functional and dysfunctional answer gets a numerical score, which can then be averaged over all respondents and plotted on a 2D graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, features should be prioritized such that this order is followed: <b>Must-Be &gt; Performance &gt; Attractive &gt; Indifferent.</b></p>
<p>There are <strong>a lot more details</strong> that are worth exploring about this method. I wrote <strong>an extensive, in-depth <a href="http://foldingburritos.com/kano-model/" target="_blank">guide to the Kano model</a></strong> that explains the entire process and gives you a step-by-step guide on how to use it.</p>
<h1 id="buyafeature">Buy a Feature</h1>
<p><em>Buy a Feature</em> is a fun <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Games-Creating-Breakthrough-Collaborative/dp/0321437292" target="_blank">innovation game</a> that can be played collaboratively or individually. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>A set of features that need to be prioritized are presented to a group of buyers (our customers);</p>
<ol>
<li>Each buyer gets a budget of play money to spend on features;</li>
<li>Each feature is priced according to some measure of cost (complexity, effort, actual cost to develop, etc.) — as long as it’s the same criteria for all features, you can use any one you prefer;</li>
<li>Each player’s budget should be between a third to half of the total cost for all features;</li>
<li>It’s possible to play the game in one of two ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Individually</strong> — Players are told to use their budget to buy the features that are most important to them;</li>
<li><strong>Collaboratively</strong> — Using a pricing scale that makes some features too expensive for individual buyers to purchase. This forces collaboration and negotiation between players to buy features that are valued by multiple players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As players buy features, collect the money and ask them to explain why they’re buying it;</li>
<li>The game ends when the money runs out or when players have bought all the features they’re interested in (explain to them beforehand that it’s OK for money to be left over).</li>
</ol>
<p>This will yield a valuable set of insights on the most important features for customers, as we can analyze which features got bought the most, the reasons for their purchase and which collaborative bids were made on expensive items.</p>
<p>To get more data, multiple instances of the game can be played (in groups of 8 people at most). Also, for large feature sets, you can <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/innovgames/why-buy-a-feature-is-great-at-prioritizing-features" target="_blank">set up a championship</a> where popular features are bubbled up through multiple phases of games.</p>
<p>Buy a Feature is best played in person due to its collaborative character, but there are <a href="http://www.innovationgames.com/buy-a-feature/" target="_blank">online solutions</a> if that’s what you need.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.uxforthemasses.com/buy-the-feature/" target="_blank">this article</a> for a more detailed game explanation and templates for feature cards and play money notes.</p>
<p><strong>A side-note for Project Managers</strong><br />
This method is also very useful for internal or consulting projects that are not exposed to the market, by involving stakeholders as the buyers in the game. It’s a great way to build strategy for the project, consensus on what’s most important, and communicate to stakeholders the notion that features have different development costs.</p>
<h1 id="storymapping">Story Mapping</h1>
<p>Story Maps were first introduced by Jeff Patton in <a href="http://agileproductdesign.com/writing/how_you_slice_it.pdf" target="_blank">this 2005 article</a> and followed-up <a href="http://jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/" target="_blank">by another one</a> writing up his more recent experience. Both are excellent reads that I can’t recommend highly enough.</p>
<p>The main idea behind Story Maps is that single-list product backlogs are a terrible way to organize and prioritize the work that needs to be done. A richer structure is necessary.</p>
<p>In very broad strokes, a Story Map is organized like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a horizontal axis that represents <strong>usage sequence</strong>;
<ul>
<li>User stories (or “tasks”) are placed along this axis, in the sequence in which they are performed by the user;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The vertical axis stands for <strong>criticality</strong>;
<ul>
<li>User stories (or “tasks”) are arranged vertically as to how important they are (from top to bottom);</li>
<li>Equally important stories can be kept at the same height, but keep in mind that, in general, it’s important to differentiate stories’ relative importance to be able to create better release plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groups of related user stories can be grouped as Activities:
<ul>
<li>Create a vertical line to separate groups of stories from others;</li>
<li>For example, an activity may be “managing email,” with “send an email to one or more addresses” being a user task;</li>
<li>Activities sit above the vertical axis and don’t have any usage sequence, they “just are” — these activities compose the major attributes for the product and can’t be prioritized (think “you can’t prioritize a car’s motor over its wheels”)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1256" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-884x654-300x222.png" alt="Story Map" width="600" height="444" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-884x654-300x222.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-884x654-768x568.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-884x654.png 884w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>There are many advantages to this kind of backlog organization, but the most relevant to prioritization and execution are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a visual tool that lets customers, stakeholders and development team members share a common understanding of what the system does;</li>
<li>It very clearly defines how to incrementally release product iterations that deliver complete working releases with increasing sophistication — this is Alistair Cockburn’s concept of the <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Walking+skeleton" target="_blank">walking skeleton</a>.
<ul>
<li>To define releases, create horizontal lines along the map, selecting stories with equivalent criticality levels;</li>
<li>This leads to complete end-to-end versions of the product and consequently to faster delivery and market validation (crucial at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">MVP</a> stage.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-1257 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-release-884x566-300x192.png" alt="Release planning with Story Maps: &quot;breadth-first implementation&quot; " width="600" height="384" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-release-884x566-300x192.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-release-884x566-768x492.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/story-map-release-884x566.png 884w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the main drawback for this structure (and the necessary time investment to create and groom it) is that it’s too heavy for projects or products in highly dynamic contexts. That is, when visibility into the future shape of the product is not great (e.g. sub 3 to 6 months), I prefer <a href="http://foldingburritos.com/articles/2015/07/06/organizing-a-large-product-backlog/">a different (but related) approach</a>.</p>
<h1 id="prunethetree">Prune the Product Tree</h1>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Games-Creating-Breakthrough-Collaborative/dp/0321437292" target="_blank">innovation game</a> from Luke Hohmann. <a href="http://www.innovationgames.com/prune-the-product-tree/" target="_blank">Prune the Product Tree</a> is about shaping the product’s direction towards market needs, but also understanding if some product areas are being left behind.</p>
<p>The analogy in the game is that the product is a tree that will be pruned to our liking. Although gardeners do this by cutting parts of the tree, <strong>the goal is to shape</strong> — it’s not about the cutting.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh765981(v=vs.120).aspx#Prune">how it works</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a large tree on a whiteboard or sheet of paper;</li>
<li>Thick limbs represent core product areas and its outermost branches represent currently available features;</li>
<li>Write potential new features on some Post-It notes;</li>
<li>Ask customers and stakeholders to place their desired features on the tree, thus defining its next phase of growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here you may extract valuable data points. Is the tree growing in a balanced way? Are specific areas growing disproportionately larger? Are previously under-developed areas growing now?</p>
<p>Having a shared view of the entire span of the product with customers can be very insightful when planning new releases. From this visual balance you derive relative value among features, understand which strategic shifts might need to be done and which areas of the product are good candidates for being dropped in the future.</p>
<h1 id="scorecard">Scorecard</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://techproductmanagement.com/product_management_scorecard/" target="_blank">Scorecard</a> is another <a href="https://www.google.com/?q=scorecard+prioritization" target="_blank">popular</a> technique. The goal is to prioritize features over a set of criteria that have been negotiated with stakeholders. Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/delizalde" target="_blank">Daniel Elizalde</a>’s sensible take on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a clear strategy that has been validated by users;</li>
<li>Select the features that are most related to the overall strategy for the next release;</li>
<li>Define a criteria and weights for scoring;</li>
<li>Meet with stakeholders and fine-tune the criteria and weights;</li>
<li>Go over all candidate features/themes and assign a score (e.g. from 1 to 100) on their respective impact for each criterion.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-1259 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scorecard-table-884x255-300x87.png" alt="Scorecard table" width="499" height="144" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scorecard-table-884x255-300x87.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scorecard-table-884x255-768x222.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/scorecard-table-884x255.png 884w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/tools/theme-scoring" target="_blank">Another way</a> to allow full use of the point scale is to identify a feature/theme that is considered to be in the middle of it for each criterion. Then, score all other features in comparison to that one; a shorter scale (from 1 to 5) will work best in this approach.</p>
<p>The scorecard can be a useful exercise for companies to evaluate what they believe is the relative impact on strategic objectives for a group of possible new features.</p>
<p>There is however very valid criticism for this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it scoring the right things? (i.e. are scoring categories really aligned with the product strategy?)</li>
<li>Are weights and scores “cooked” to prioritize features already favored by opinion and politics, while at the same time give the appearance of objective analysis?</li>
<li>It can lead to fragmented products, unfocused from their Unique Value Proposition.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="kjmethod">KJ Method</h1>
<p>One final Japanese technique in this overview. The <a href="https://www.uie.com/articles/kj_technique/" target="_blank">KJ Method</a> is a technique devised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Kawakita" target="_blank">Jiro Kawakita</a> as a group process to establish priorities. It quickly produces “objective group consensus out of a collection of subjective, opinionated data.” It’s on the Internal side of techniques as the way its usage is described is mostly targeted at stakeholders within the same organization.</p>
<p>UIE describes an 8-step process for any group size in under an hour. First, ensure you have the following preconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removable sticky notes in two colors;</li>
<li>Room with lots of wall space;</li>
<li>One person to be the facilitator (moving the group from one step to the next);</li>
<li>Whiteboard or flip-chart for the final ranking step.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of the above, the facilitator follows this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Determine a Focus Question.</strong> The focus question drives the results. Every session will have its own focus question (e.g. “Who are our users?” or “What goals do users have when they come to our site?” etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Organize the Group.</strong> People in the group should be from different parts of the organization, to get more diverse perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Put Opinions (or Data) onto Sticky Notes.</strong> Putting one item on each sticky note, each group participant is asked to brainstorm as many items as they can think of.</li>
<li><strong>Put Sticky Notes on the Wall.</strong> Each participant puts their sticky notes up on the wall in random order. They also read other people’s contributions. If they think of something else that should go on the wall, at any time, they can just add it to the collection.</li>
<li><strong>Group Similar Items.</strong> Once everyone has added their contributions to the wall, the facilitator instructs the group to start grouping similar items in another part of the room.</li>
<li><strong>Naming Each Group.</strong> Each participant is asked to assign a name to every group, using the second color of sticky notes.</li>
<li><strong>Voting for the Most Important Groups.</strong> Participants are asked to individually use their own viewpoint to choose which groups he or she believes are most important to answering the focus question.</li>
<li><strong>Ranking the Most Important Groups.</strong> This is the final and most important step. All individual sticky notes are placed on the whiteboard and ordered by number of votes. Participants can combine similar groups, which adds their votes and moves them up the ranking. When three to four groups have much higher ranking than the rest, the facilitator may stop the exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the combination of free individual opinion through voting and the enforced unanimous consensus in the final step, this method can quickly converge to a group buy-in of priorities. This helps any teams that depend upon stakeholders’ participation and agreement on the product strategy and priorities.</p>
<h1 id="valuevscost">Value vs. Cost</h1>
<p>This is a very common prioritization technique with the advantage of also being very simple. Features are scored on their Value and Cost of implementation. <strong>Those with the best ratios will have higher priority.</strong></p>
<p>Also called <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2008/10/20/planning-sprints-part-2/" target="_blank"><em>bang for the buck</em></a>, the inherent ROI-like analysis in this method feels intuitive and is also embedded within other prioritization techniques.</p>
<p>The main goal with this method is that we try to <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2007/07/31/prioritization-and-value-maximization/" target="_blank"><strong>maximize value delivery</strong></a> over time. That is, for a given release timeframe, we work on the most valuable items we can fit in the period.</p>
<p>To visualize this technique, use a Value vs. Cost graph. Scatter plot all features being considered, with regards to their score in each dimension. Then, prioritization rankings will be visible as the slopes of the lines going from the origin to each feature. The higher the slope, the higher the priority.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1260" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/value-vs-cost-884x736-300x250.png" alt="Value vs. Cost Prioritization" width="400" height="333" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/value-vs-cost-884x736-300x250.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/value-vs-cost-884x736-768x639.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/value-vs-cost-884x736.png 884w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>However, one thing to look out for is the tendency to prioritize low-cost, low-value items (which have good Value/Cost ratios). As Teresa Torres <a href="http://www.producttalk.org/2014/02/the-simplest-and-most-important-question-you-face-as-a-product-leader/" target="_blank">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you use time-to-build to prioritize what to build next, you’ll end up with a product full of easy solutions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, just carefully consider what comes out of prioritization methods and use them as guidelines and not definitive answers.</p>
<h1 id="featurebuckets">Feature Buckets</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.adamnash.com/2009/07/22/guide-to-product-planning-three-feature-buckets/" target="_blank">Feature Buckets</a> technique by <a href="https://twitter.com/adamnash" target="_blank">Adam Nash</a> is also very popular on <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features/answer/Adam-Nash" target="_blank">Quora</a>.</p>
<p>Adam believes that feature prioritization varies a lot across different product types and industries and that’s why he emphasizes that this technique was thought specifically for consumer internet products.</p>
<p>Feature concepts should be placed in one of four buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metrics Movers</strong> — Features that will move the target business and product metrics significantly. There should be specific goals and strategies behind the decision to invest in a product or feature (things like AARRR metrics come in handy here);</li>
<li><strong>Customer Requests</strong> — These are features that have been requested directly by customers. They are usually incremental enhancements, but it’s important to consider them or else risk alienating users or miss important feedback coming from their usage of the product;</li>
<li><strong>Delight</strong> — Innovative features that are internally generated based on insights in design or technology. Working on surprising and exciting features is important to delight customers and create a differentiated position in the market (c.f. Kano Model for more on this);</li>
<li><strong>Strategic</strong> — Features that are included for strategic reasons related to learning or future goals (e.g. experimentation and data gathering).</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-balanced product release should typically include features from all of these buckets. The framework is not explicit as to the appropriate distributions among these buckets and to how to prioritize internally within each. These implementation details are left up to the Product Manager to define.</p>
<h1 id="ianmcallister">Ian McAllister’s Framework</h1>
<p>I don’t think this framework has an official name (hence the uncreative one I’m using). Given <a href="http://twitter.com/ianmcall" target="_blank">its author’s experience</a> and the huge popularity it has on <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features/answer/Ian-McAllister" target="_blank">Quora</a>, it’s well worth including in this overview. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define the important themes for the product or business</strong><br />
Create a list of the most important themes (e.g. customer acquisition, engagement, activation, ARPU) and select the top three.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize and resource the themes</strong><br />
Define the relative priority for each theme and how much resources you want to invest in each (team members, marketing, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Generate project ideas</strong><br />
Use projects ideas you already have for each theme and come up with new ones. Keep in mind the Pareto principle and focus on the 20% of the project that will get you to 80% of the desired outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Estimate each project’s potential impact</strong><br />
Work out the impact you expect from each project, in very broad terms (think order-of-magnitude-similar.)</li>
<li><strong>Estimate each project’s costs</strong><br />
With your team’s (and relevant stakeholder’s) help, come up with an estimation for each project’s costs.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize project within each theme</strong><br />
Set priorities considering the projects with the best impact-to-cost ratios.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should check out Ian’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features/answer/Ian-McAllister" target="_blank">original answer</a> for more details and to read about the multiple benefits he finds in this framework. Out of those, the one that jumps out to me as <strong>the most useful is to resource themes independently</strong>. That is: pick the important themes and assign team members and other resources beforehand. This <strong>sets you free from constantly struggling to prioritize very different themes that you may be developing in parallel.</strong></p>
<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
<p>After going through all of these techniques you will have probably noticed that <strong>they each have contexts in which they make sense to be used and others when they don’t.</strong> As much as we’d like to, there are no prioritization silver bullets and we have to choose whatever is more appropriate for our product, team, industry, etc. At the same time, <strong>there are important commonalities among these methods that are worth pointing out.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go over the <strong>most important takeaways</strong> from this fascinating task we call Prioritizing.</p>
<h2>1. Prioritize at a high-level</h2>
<p>Essentially <strong>all prioritization methods work with high-level features (themes) and user goals.</strong> This is important for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The focus is on providing value to the user and not the minutia (at least at first);</li>
<li>You don’t waste as much time if/when the strategy changes;</li>
<li>After working out the strategy and high-level priorities, the team should take care of finding the best tactics to get there.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Set goals, measure and adjust</h2>
<p>Another common characteristic among many techniques is their focus on Effectiveness. They have an underlying notion that our motivation to prioritize is that we’re going after some goal with a measurable effect (impact, ROI, usage, improved business metric, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The objective is not to set priorities and ship them.</strong> The objective is to <strong>constantly be aware if what we’re doing is really adding value and working out as expected</strong>; when it’s not, we will at least have some clues as to what needs adjustment.</p>
<h2>3. Don’t do it alone</h2>
<p><strong>Prioritization should not be a solo effort.</strong> With the exception of very simple methods, almost all of them involve someone else in the process. Be they customers, stakeholders or team members, it’s very rare that the Product Manager alone will set the overall priorities. <strong>We’re just in charge of a process</strong> and the product <a href="http://blog.cauvin.org/2011/12/who-owns-product.html" target="_blank">belongs to the team</a>.</p>
<p>Getting the most external input we can gets us buy-in and confidence that what gets prioritized is effectively valuable. And even then, we’re only sure after measuring the actual results.</p>
<h2>4. Quantitative vs. Qualitative</h2>
<p><strong>Quantitative does not mean better than qualitative (and vice-versa).</strong> For instance, a common pitfall when using quantitative prioritization methods is that people associate numbers with precision and confidence. Seeing formulas, ratios and rankings usually makes us feel more assured as to the robustness and objectivity of some type of analysis, but these can be gamed. You should keep this in mind both for yourself and when presenting results to other people — these things are guidelines and not infallible outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Know what you’re getting out of the method</strong> and when to use it. These things are tools, not oracles.</p>
<h2>5. External vs. Internal</h2>
<p>The External and Internal distinction that we’ve used in this guide relates to how much external involvement there is in the prioritization process. The scale goes something like this: You &lt; Team &lt; Stakeholders &lt; Customers.</p>
<p>Again, it all depends on the results you’re trying to get. I’ve personally found it useful to think about it in these terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External techniques</strong> are better for prioritizing<strong> abstract outcomes</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Internal techniques</strong> are better for prioritizing <strong>concrete solutions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The value of External techniques</strong><br />
In broad terms, external techniques are most useful when you’re trying to navigate through a large set of candidate features, looking to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the most valuable ones for your customers – knowing their baseline and performance expectations and also what delights them;</li>
<li>Getting buy-in and consensus from a group of key stakeholders in larger organizations;</li>
<li>Gauging which features are not bringing value or actively displeasing customers so you can decide whether to improve or to drop them;</li>
<li>Getting clients in consulting projects to participate and sign-off on the development strategy and release plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you’re dealing mostly with “the outside world” is only natural that discussions and prioritization here happen at a more abstract level of user outcomes, goals and high-level features.</p>
<p><strong>The value of Internal techniques</strong><br />
Because you’re involving people that are closer to the product and technology, these techniques are best for prioritizing among more concrete and problems. That is, they’re less exploratory as end users are less involved (if at all). Thus, they work best whenever you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further refine the results obtained from one of the more externally oriented techniques;</li>
<li>Prioritize a set of features and ideas that you’re confident are aligned with the product strategy and customers’ expectations;</li>
<li>Work on internal projects without much (or no) contact with the market;</li>
<li>Quickly prioritize low level features and requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of these techniques and takeaways in hand, it’s now up to you. Mix and match them. Make changes. But above all, go out and build great products.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit of a cliché, but last time I was in San Francisco, I realized something important about my work as a product manager.</p>
<h1>I’m not building the Golden Gate Bridge.</h1>
<p>Not to knock the Golden Gate. It’s very efficient for getting from A to B. And it’s pretty. Google “Golden Gate,” and you’ll find thousands of landscape shots. Blue skies, rolling hills, miles of orange steel.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-952 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/goldengate.jpg" alt="golden gate bridge" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/goldengate.jpg 900w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/goldengate-300x199.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/goldengate-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Seeing the Golden Gate up close, I was reminded of how software used to be. It got you from A to B—and didn’t do much else. It was big. It was “impressive.” It imposed itself on the landscape of your day. What you saw was what you got.</p>
<p>Software used to be strictly business. But with the intertwining of B2B and B2C, the same user who needs a SaaS tool to manage complex business tasks probably Ubers home to watch Netflix. And she’s comparing her SaaS tools to Uber and Netflix. (At least, that’s what I do…)</p>
<p>Software is now one element in an ecosystem. It’s not the defining feature in the terrain of your day. And it does a whole lot more than simply take you from A to B. To succeed, software products must offer a delightful experience. Which is why I’m adopting a more relevant bridge-related metaphor for my approach to product management.</p>

<h1>I’m building the High Line.</h1>
<p>For those of you who haven’t visited the <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/" target="_blank">High Line</a>, it’s a 1.45-mile-long park built along an elevated section of an old New York City railway. Walking the High Line, you travel through gardens and art projects. The first time I was there, I forgot that I was moving from one place to another. It felt like I was part of the city’s nervous system. Google “High Line,” and you’ll find thousands of photographs taken from eye-level along the pathway. People document the experience of being there.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-953 size-full aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/highline.jpg" alt="High Line Park, New York" width="736" height="450" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/highline.jpg 736w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/highline-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
<h2>Functional AND Simple AND Beautiful</h2>
<p>Users now expect an experience that’s more like the High Line. Take Uber. It’s designed to literally take you from A to B. Efficiency and simplicity are its selling points. But Uber doesn’t just shuttle you from place to place—it offers a delightful <em>experience</em> of efficiency. (It’s also using some pretty sophisticated algorithms.)</p>
<p>That’s why Uber has been ingrained in our ecosystem. Products that require you to spend a perceived “least amount of time on them” while fulfilling your goal are absolute gold. The less time you perceive to be spending on a product, the more likely you are to use it. Just ask my Visa bill.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-947" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/uber-300x190.png" alt="building bridges" width="510" height="323" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/uber-300x190.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/uber-768x486.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/uber.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>The fact that these products become verbs—Slack me, Uber there, Google it—signals the degree to which they are ingrained in our ecosystem. They&#8217;re part of our language.</p>
<p>To achieve this status, products require more than utility. There are thousands of cereals out there. In the past, oatmeal was enough to get you full. Now we spend a small fortune on the healthiest, heartiest, goji berry, chia seed, beautifully-packaged-so-it-looks-good-in-my- hipster-kitchen cereal. (Again, myself included.) The fancy cereal offers the experience of simplicity—of not being processed. A back-to-the-earth integrity. But making and delivering that cereal is anything but simple. It’s the same for software.</p>
<h2>Simple for users, not for PMs</h2>
<p>As a product manager, I’m trying to create both the experience and illusion of simplicity. When I think about building the Golden Gate Bridge, I picture huge cranes, tons of steel and thousands of workers covered in dirt. When I think about building the High Line, I envision children planting trees. Is that how it happened? Hell, no. But an illusion of simplicity makes you and your product more accessible to your customer base—even if it’s nowhere close to reality of building a product.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a product manager, I’m trying to create both the experience and illusion of simplicity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creating the illusion of simplicity is what I call the “last mile” in design. If our products, on the front-end, were as complicated as they are on the back-end, no average user would want to use them. On the other hand, if they were as simple, on the back-end, as they appear on the front-end, they would never impress or delight us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-942 size-full" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/buildingbridges.jpg" alt="I'm building the High Line, not the Brooklyn Bridge." width="510" height="323" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/buildingbridges.jpg 510w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/buildingbridges-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<p>You’re not developing a calculator. You’re talking about masking a convoluted series of gets, puts and posts while providing a seamless series of interactions for your consumers (and hopefully inspiring awe in your design colleagues). Here’s where the 80/20 principle does not apply. That last 20% (more like 5%, if you ask me) takes the longest and will envelop you with decision fatigue. And it’s the only way to reach that elusive state of product excellence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a lot of product managers, writing probably isn’t on the radar. You’ve got shit to build. People are (probably) shouting at you. Who wants to fuss over something as boring and finicky as sentence structure?</p>
<p>But product management isn’t just about technical deployment. A lot of your day-to-day revolves around alignment: building it, wanting it, struggling to keep it in check. Those people shouting at you? Writing can be a powerful tool to get everyone in sync.</p>
<p>In fact, we consider it an “essential” for product strategy alignment.</p>
<p>To help explore this concept, we chatted with the awesome and thoughtful <a href="https://twitter.com/ellenchisa" target="_blank">Ellen Chisa</a>. Currently VP of Product at <a href="https://www.lolatravel.com/" target="_blank">Lola</a>, Ellen has used her blog (<a href="https://blog.ellenchisa.com/migrating-to-medium-eb5e98cfe4a1#.p2aukxgq2" target="_blank">recently migrated to Medium</a>) to share firsthand insights from the field. Having started her PM career at Microsoft and then Kickstarter, she’s seen product management from a variety of vantages. Her blog covers everything from <a href="https://blog.ellenchisa.com/an-intro-to-pm-interviewing-a7b2e730cfbc?source=user_profile---------11-" target="_blank">product management interviewing</a> to the <a href="https://blog.ellenchisa.com/the-dark-side-of-pm-6a0c45c331bc#.9iv6kkafp" target="_blank">dark side of her job</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@ellenchisa/minimum-bar-diversity-2b8342428de4#.ays78tmpe" target="_blank">diversity in tech</a>. She also has a fantastic Twitter account.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">When you find an awesome job, do whatever needs to be done to stay in it and keep learning.</p>
<p>— Ellen Chisa (@ellenchisa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ellenchisa/status/748652869314838529">June 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But Ellen doesn’t just write on her off-hours. Within her day-to-day, she uses writing to facilitate consensus and get stuff built. She gave us some insight into her approach.</p>
<h1>Why nurture writing?</h1>
<p>“World-class communication” is <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-product-manager/" target="_blank">often listed among PMs’ essential capabilities</a>. But what actually makes someone a good communicator? Writing is huge—but few product product managers consciously develop it as a skill.</p>
<p>“Writing is one of the things that everyone at the company can share,” Ellen explains. “Not everyone can be in the code base. Not everyone’s going to be reading the customer service tickets. A lot of the time, writing is how you end up communicating.”</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-788 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/differentfishies-2-300x68.png" width="582" height="132" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/differentfishies-2-300x68.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/differentfishies-2-768x174.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/differentfishies-2-1024x231.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /></p>
<p>Every month, Ellen sends an email recapping the roadmap from the previous month: what got done, what didn’t, what changed, and how successful they were. “To some extent you need everyone in the company on the same page about what direction you’re going and why. One way to communicate more at scale, besides just talking to everyone individually, is by writing it down and documenting it.”</p>
<p>A written document gets everyone on the same page. Literally.</p>

<h1>What do we mean by “writing”?</h1>
<p>Okay, dumb question. But we wanted to emphasize that “writing” isn’t just for books or blogs. Emails are “writing.” Specs are “writing.” Talking on Slack can even be “writing.”</p>
<p>While in her first PM gig at Microsoft, Ellen started to understand the power of writing in less “writerly” contexts. “My first manager at Microsoft actually cared very deeply about meeting notes and how meeting notes were worded and written,” she explains, “He didn’t talk as much about the writing so much as, ‘How do you share the notes? What do the notes mean?’&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-805 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Artboard-2-300x129.png" alt="Artboard 2" width="300" height="129" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Artboard-2-300x129.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Artboard-2-768x330.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Artboard-2-1024x441.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Our recommendation: start thinking of all your written communication—whether it’s meeting notes, emails or user stories—as “writing.” It’s easy to be lazy over email. After all, it’s just an email. But by giving casual communication a little more care, you can smooth and strengthen your alignment process.</p>
<h1>“Good writing” for product managers</h1>
<p>So what does “good writing” mean for product managers? It’s not about clever turns of phrase. (Actually, it’s kinda the opposite.) Ellen told us her top 3 writing qualities for PMs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity.</strong> In other words, knowing when to shut up. “I’ve noticed that it’s tempting, when you’re trying to be clear, to put down everything,” Ellen says, “But you can end up with too much convoluted information. Not everyone needs to wade through everything you waded through.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economy.</strong> With clarity comes brevity. As Ellen puts it: “If you can write clearly, you’ll be able to make a much shorter document, there will be less confusion, and you’ll be more likely to build the right thing the first time.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Openness.</strong> “Even though you’re defining specifics, your tone still needs to be open—as though you’re open to talking and you want to hear questions,” Ellen says, “You want people to critique you if they think you’re wrong. So you have to stay confident but still open-minded. It’s a hard tone balance to strike.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="wp-image-789 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/chatbubbles-2-300x167.png" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/chatbubbles-2-300x167.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/chatbubbles-2.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h1>3 ways to improve your writing</h1>
<p>Writing is hard skill—it’s a muscle that can be trained. We asked Ellen to provide some concrete tips for product managers wanting to finesse their style.</p>
<p><strong>Read it out loud.</strong> <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/1682768/say-it-out-loud-how-david-sedaris-makes-his-writing-better" target="_blank">It’s a classic writing tip</a>, and it works. How does that sentence sound? Does it flow? When in doubt, go “grade four”: use super-simple sentences and write exactly how you would say something out loud. Again, less words = more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Vet it…</strong> BUT don’t just ask someone to read something and tell you what they think. Ask them to tell you what they understood. When Ellen gets a colleague to review her writing, she asks: “What do you think I was trying to get across with this email?”</p>
<p><strong>Invest the time.</strong> Ellen says she spends about four hours writing her monthly recap emails. “Writing badly is quick. Writing well takes a really long time,” Ellen says. “I think it’s worth it, but it can be hard to justify since there’s not this immediate, tangible outcome.”</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-790 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/finswriting-1-300x147.png" width="429" height="210" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/finswriting-1-300x147.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/finswriting-1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></p>
<h1>Template: Meeting Notes</h1>
<p>Once you’ve mastered your style, master your structure. Developing repeatable formats for common internal communications—like meeting notes—facilitates alignment by removing ambiguity. Ellen emailed us a few pointers to keep in mind when writing meeting notes.<br />
<img class="wp-image-801 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-1-2-300x102.png" alt="writing-product-management-1" width="797" height="271" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-1-2-300x102.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-1-2.png 712w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<p>Our own product manager, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sameenavelshi" target="_blank">Sameena</a>, describes herself as “particular” when it comes to meeting notes. She put together this handy (and copy-pastable) template for everyday meeting notes. You can use this template to structure your meeting before it happens, or to document what went down.</p>
<div style="width: 650px; height: 940px; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; border: 3px solid #06aad1; margin: 0 auto;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"><b>Purpose/Goals</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bulleted list of what you want to accomplish in the meeting (write this down before the meeting).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"><b>Agenda</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">Numbered list of items up for discussion (again: put this together before the meeting).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"><b>What we know</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">Bulleted list of key pieces of information to keep in mind that pertain to your goals. This could be a list of talking points from a previous iteration of the same meeting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Item 1: Should correspond to Item #1 in your agenda</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">For each item in your agenda, create a bullet list of key discussion points from the meeting. This should include</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">The current situation</li>
<li style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">What you want to do instead</li>
<li style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">The limitations</li>
<li style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">What was discussed</li>
<li style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">What you need to accomplish your goal</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"><b>Next Steps: </b>For each item, write a bulleted list of next steps. We recommend assigning a champion for each &#8220;next step&#8221; in parentheses next to the text.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><em>Repeat for other items in your agenda.</em><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;"><b>Task List</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 22.5px;">Write each person&#8217;s name, then write a list of tasks. This should correspond to the tasks listed in the Next Steps sections. Repetition is your friend.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Customize this template to fit your needs. Key points: 1) make clear WHY you’re in the meeting, 2) section your notes into digestible chunks (not just a big long bulleted list, 3) make it clear WHO is doing WHAT (and reinforce ownership with repetition).</p>
<h1>Template: Company-Wide Communication</h1>
<p>Ellen also sent us a few tips for putting together solid all-team emails.<br />
<img class="wp-image-802 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-2-1-300x97.png" alt="writing-product-management-2" width="804" height="260" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-2-1-300x97.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/writing-product-management-2-1.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /></p>
<p>Over here at Roadmunk, Sameena recommends structuring your organizational updates according to the following rundown:</p>
<div style="width: 600px; height: 670px; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; border: 3px solid #06aad1; margin: 0 auto;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Goals from the past month/quarter/year.</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Bulleted list of high-level goals for whatever time period you’re recapping</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Things that were done well and why</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">And who deserves kudos!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Things we can improve on and how</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Don’t just say what went wrong. State actionable steps that can be taken to improve the process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>What’s coming up</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">State your overall strategy for the upcoming period, along with a bulleted list of high-level goals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Important notes</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Any important caveats or concerns with regards to executing your upcoming goals?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Request feedback</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px;">Ask people to tell you what they think!</span></p>
</div>
<h1>Final thoughts: Writing doesn’t just align—it gets you ahead</h1>
<p>Still not convinced that writing is worth working on? A big part of any product manager’s success depends on their communication—and writing can travel a lot farther than the meeting room.</p>
<p>“Broader written communication can help you get noticed by other people around the company,” Ellen says, “and that can help you move forward in your career as people see how you think through problems and how you solve them.”</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You just got hired in your first role as a product manager. It’s up to you to prioritize features, coordinate with developers, and ship elegant user experiences. To make this happen, you’ve been handed a slate of apps and tools, a stellar team, and a lot of freedom to accomplish your objectives. Only problem: you’ve never written a line of code, and you don&#8217;t speak technical jargon. So you’re feeling just a <em>little</em> confused and/or freaked out.</p>
<p>This is a common predicament for PMs making the transition from non-technical roles. Product management is, by definition, such a cross-functional field—touching on engineering, sales, business, marketing, customer success, psychotherapy, basket weaving—that newbies from any background inevitably bring transferable skills. But they also face an inevitable learning curve. And that curve can be especially steep when your background isn’t in engineering.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-386 size-full aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/technical-pm.png" alt="" width="750" height="360" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/technical-pm.png 750w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/technical-pm-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pm_suzie">Suzie Prince</a>, Head of Product for <a href="https://twitter.com/tw_studios">ThoughtWorks Studios</a>, successfully scaled her own learning curve. After completing a master’s degree in botany and taxonomy, she joined ThoughtWorks in a business analyst role before venturing into product. She now works on a software tool for software developers—i.e. a technical product for a <em>super</em>-technical user base. Prince says she could never have predicted her career trajectory. Which means she’s in a prime position to share insights for early-stage PMs still wrapping their heads around the role. Here are her top tips.</p>
<h2>Learn the language</h2>
<p>You don’t need to code to be a product manager. But you do need to know how to collaborate with people who do. A good baseline: understanding what everyone is talking about. Product managers are like translators. Each department has its own “language,” whether it’s engineering, sales, marketing or customer success. PMs must interpret information from each department and translate it to others in a language they can understand (<a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=nontechnicalpms" target="_blank">roadmaps are essentially helpful here *hint, hint*</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>You need to be able to understand how your development teams are working, their practice. Because you need to be kind of at one with them. –Suzie Prince</p></blockquote>
<p>Prince learned the technical language in the same way exchange students pick up Italian: through immersion. Although she took a basic training course through her job, she says her most valuable learning has been through osmosis. “As much as possible, I try to sit very closely to the development team,” Prince says, “and I try to pair with them on tasks if I can.” And developers aren’t the only resources for immersive learning. Prince also recommends spending time with the support team, who often possess in-depth knowledge about the product. The goal isn’t to learn how to do something—it’s to learn how to <em>talk</em> about that thing. “Basically understand what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, but maybe not the nitty gritty.”</p>

<h2>Openness = Trust</h2>
<p>When things get confusing, it’s tempting to just nod along. But Prince advises against the fake-it-til-you-make-it approach. “Don’t be afraid if you don’t have a technical background,” she advises, “Everybody’s gonna know straight away, anyway. So I think be honest, be open, and ask questions.”</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-358 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/faking-it-300x74.png" alt="faking-it" width="440" height="109" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/faking-it-300x74.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/faking-it.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Honesty, openness and curiosity are essential qualities for building trust. And trust is imperative to strong, productive relationships with your engineering team. Rather than trying to hide the gaps in your knowledge base, ask colleagues to fill you in. Prince says she likes to reiterate the problem—“This is the picture I have in my head. Is this what you were saying?”—or set aside time for one-on-one learning. “What I’ve found sometimes with technical team members is in the moment they can be pretty full-on or boisterous,” she says, “But afterward I’ll be humble and say, ‘Hey, you seem super knowledgeable about this whole part of the system. I don’t really understand that. Can we get coffee? Can you draw on the whiteboard for me?’”</p>
<h2>Hone some technical “essentials”</h2>
<p>Again, you don’t need to code to be a product manager. But it can be helpful to pick up a few processes that will allow you to better understand both your product and your users. Don’t try to learn a whole new field just for the sake of it—focus on skills that are directly applicable to your day-to-day as a product manager. “You can learn to run some simple queries in your database, or use a logging tool. If you can learn to access that data, it’s super useful. Especially coming from the creative side, people can be nervous about doing that. But I would say the power is well worth learning.”</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-368 aligncenter" src="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mvpm-300x51.png" alt="mvpm" width="440" height="75" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mvpm-300x51.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mvpm.png 440w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Think of yourself as an MVPM: Minimum Viable Product Manager. You don’t need bells and whistles in your technical skill set. You just need to identify a few key technical processes that will help you ace your job.</p>
<h2>Don’t wait to be 101%</h2>
<p>With confusion comes intimidation—which can significantly stall your progression. So think like an MVPM. In Prince’s words: “Don’t wait to be asked to do something. If you feel like you can take on that technical demo, or you can write that help doc, or you can explain to your customer how the system works, don’t wait to be 101% confident of it. Most of my experiences have been that you worry a lot, but if you’re spending a full day with a product, and all day with a technical team, at some point you are going to know more than other people. It’s okay to just try.”</p>
<p>If you wait to have “perfect” technical knowledge to dive into your role, you’ll never actually launch.</p>
<h2>Take advantage of not knowing</h2>
<p>Regardless of your background, you bring something unique to your role as a PM. But Prince also notes that there’s an advantage to <em>not</em> knowing the technical side: it could make you more inquisitive. “I’ve actually found that I make less assumptions about what our users want. And less assumptions about what they’re going to expect. So the ‘tell me more’ is a genuine ‘tell me more,’ because I want them to tell me.”</p>

<p>It’s well-known that empathy is a crucial skill for product managers. The less you know, the less likely you are to jump to conclusions. This opens the door to empathy: it’s a chance to put yourself in others’ shoes, hear their perspectives, and ask a lot of questions without injecting your own opinion. Your window of “not knowing” will only last so long. Use it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m one of those “don’t talk to me until after my coffee” people. Mornings are not my most productive (or cheerful) time. So I was pretty pleased when I discovered an achievable tweak to my morning routine that not only requires minimal effort (read: I don’t have to speak to anyone or type anything), but has also given me a fresh perspective on my daily approach to product management. Here it is:</p>
<p><em>I sit with my product roadmap for 10 minutes before doing ANYTHING else.</em></p>
<p>I don’t check my email. I don’t scan my Slack channels. I don’t talk to any colleagues. I stay far away from Trello and JIRA. I just take a few minutes to vibe out with my roadmap. (Side note: I’ve also been on a yoga kick for the past month, so this <em>might</em> be related?)</p>
<p>As product managers, we often find ourselves in “urgent” mode. We want to keep our sights on the long-term vision—but a lot of our time is spent fighting fires. Since I started allocating a few minutes to my roadmap every morning, my days have been more grounded. I analyze both the granular (what’s each dev working on today? how close are we to that next release?) and the big picture (are we on track to make quarterly goals in line with our STRATEGY?). It’s given me a new sense of control and perspective over our approach to product management.</p>

<p>My case is special. Since I’m the PM for <a href="https://roadmunk.com" target="_blank">roadmapping software</a>, when I spend 10 minutes with my roadmap, I’m <em>also</em> spending 10 minutes with my own product. Two birds, one stone. But there’s value to doing this exercise with <em>both</em> your roadmap and your product. Each approach has different benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spending 10 minutes with your roadmap every morning:</strong> This re-centres your plans. Are you going in the right direction? How should you tweak? Is obsession over everyday minutia draining your focus? Think of your roadmap as a feature, then assess how it’s working for your stakeholders and the company overall (in the same way you would assess how a product feature works for your users).</li>
<li><strong>Spending 10 minutes with your product every morning:</strong> Don’t approach this exercise with any goals or intentions. Act like a customer. Start with a blank canvas and see what new ideas and inspirations spring to mind. How do you <em>feel</em> while engaging with your product? What would improve your experience? Fill in the blanks: “It would be awesome if I could…”</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we look at our products (which in my case, also means looking at my roadmap) about 100 times per day. But something different happened after I set aside some no-distractions time as part of my routine. From looking at my roadmap, I found new actionable ways to keep our plans track. And from looking at our product, I came up with concrete ideas to get people using our app on a more regular basis.</p>
<p>You can do this on an occasional or haphazard basis. But the cool thing about making this part of your routine is that even though you’re doing the <em>same thing</em> over and over, different results emerge. Which means either I&#8217;m insane, or Einstein is wrong.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are email newsletters making a comeback? If my inbox is any indication: yes! Over the past year, some clever product people have launched non-spammy, well-curated newsletters offering hand-picked links and insights on product management, product design, UX and more. If you’re a newsletter nerd (a term we definitely just made up), you probably already subscribe to industry favourites like <a href="http://www.mindtheproduct.com/product-management-newsletter/">Prioritised</a>, <a href="https://www.productmanagerhq.com/">Product Manager HQ</a> and <a href="http://under10consulting.com/">Under10 Consulting</a>. But there are also some newer, more grassroots newsletters written by working PMs that offer sharp nuggets of wisdom alongside handy product management resources. Here are are our 5 top picks.</p>

<h2>1. Bringing the Donuts</h2>
<p>This past January, Google Ventures partner Ken Norton launched <a href="https://www.kennorton.com/newsletter/">Bringing the Donuts</a>, a weekly newsletter offering a sweet (yet surprisingly filling!) dose of product management thought leadership. (Note: Norton coined the phrase “bringing the donuts” for a <a href="https://www.kennorton.com/essays/leading-cross-functional-teams.html">now-famous slide deck</a> on cross-functional leadership back in 2005.) Seriously respected in his field, Norton’s newsletter covers the “big” questions in snack-sized bites. When should startups hire their first PM? What is the role of empathy in product management? And how can PMs and CEOs enter a Vulcan Mind Meld?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I&#8217;ve started sending out a semi-regular newsletter about product management called Bringing the Donuts. Subscribe! <a href="https://t.co/YoSqgpZodk">https://t.co/YoSqgpZodk</a></p>
<p>— Ken Norton (@kennethn) <a href="https://twitter.com/kennethn/status/694684076431663104">February 3, 2016</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>2. Product Buff</h2>
<p>If you’re going to devote a <em>full 4 minutes</em> to reading an article, you better know it’s going to be good. Pedram Daraeizadeh, an organizer at Product Hunt Montreal and ProductTank, helps his subscribers pick the right reads by explaining exactly WHY each link deserves their eyeballs. Organized by category (managing products, marketing products), <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/productbuff">Product Buff</a> doesn’t just spotlight quality links. Instead, he follows each link with a quick “READ it because” blurb, offering a concise summary of the article’s value. Very handy for those with limited time and an over-padded Twitter feed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p>My weekly product newsletter is coming out soon. You don&#8217;t want to miss it, subscribe here: <a href="https://t.co/lCVZbbwAzY">https://t.co/lCVZbbwAzY</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/prodmgmt?src=hash">#prodmgmt</a></p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>3. DailyPM</h2>
<p>When Dutch product manager Rick Pastoor kicked off <a href="http://rickpastoor.nl/">DailyPM</a> in early 2016, he didn’t attempt the same old thing. Instead of publishing on a weekly or biweekly schedule, he aimed for a more frequent (and ambitious) clip: daily. Each morning, subscribers receive a brief, thought-provoking message. Pastoor’s focus is productivity and self-improvement—but that doesn’t mean his ideas aren’t actionable. Recent missives include an overview of OKRs (what they are, how to put them into action) and simple (but practical) tips for following through on your daily goals. “Want to make enormous progress on your projects?” Pastoor ask, “Find someone that keeps you in check.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en">

<p>— Rick Pastoor (@rickpastoor) <a href="https://twitter.com/rickpastoor/status/693390919643430912">January 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>4. Weekly Thoughts of Tim Herbig</h2>
<p>Last spring, Hamburg-based product manager and self-proclaimed coffee snob Tim Herbig began curating <a href="http://herbigt.com/newsletter/">a weekly compendium</a> of his own blog posts, articles, resources and stray thoughts. Herbig writes regularly and thoughtfully on a pretty wide range of topics: from getting started as a product manager, to holding effective 30-minute meetings, to his favourite apps. But the newsletter isn’t just links Herbig’s own website. Subscribers to also get access to quick, savvy musings on whatever topic happens to cross his mind that week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p>The 1st edition of my Product Management Weekly newsletter just was sent out &#8211; Check it out! <a href="https://t.co/rFneYSzFyO">https://t.co/rFneYSzFyO</a></p>
<p>— Tim Herbig (@herbigt) <a href="https://twitter.com/herbigt/status/596692049727979521">May 8, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>5. Ray Sensenbach</h2>
<p>Design-minded product managers (which, uh, should be <em>all</em> product managers) will enjoy Ray Sensenbach’s <a href="http://raysensenbach.com/sign-up/">weekly dispatches from the field</a>. What stands out here is Sensenbach’s strong point of view. Although his project just kicked off last month, he’s already going in-depth on his subject matter, presenting highly opinionated perspectives on his industry. In his first edition, Sensenbach explained why product designers are <em>professionals</em>—not service providers. He also advocated for total transparency of process. And after a trip to Tahoe, he offered career lessons from his first snowboarding expedition. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f3c2.png" alt="🏂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>From the 'what is a product' definition to benefits, value, features and how a PM distills this complexity into something customers want.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/what-is-a-product/">What is a product?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://roadmunk.com/blog">Roadmunk Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basics. A product is a <strong>good</strong> or a <strong>service</strong> offered to customers for benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A good</strong> is a tangible or virtual item that provides certain benefits for a customer.<br />
<em>A delicious cup of coffee is a product.</em></li>
<li><strong>A service</strong> is a single or package of activities performed to fulfill benefits for the customer.<br />
<em>A professional haircut is a service.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_90" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-90" src="http://roadmunkblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-1024x405.png" alt="Products are goods and services" width="640" height="253" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-1024x405.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-300x119.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-768x304.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-750x296.png 750w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-01-1140x451.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Physical goods and intangible services are both products.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Add a little complexity, now. Plenty of goods will come bundled <em>with</em> services as additional benefits, and vice versa. A product is the sum of its features and benefits: the packaging, the support, the logistics, the convenience, the delivery, the speed, the flexibility and any number of perceived benefits. That&#8217;s how sellers differentiate their product from the competition&#8217;s.</p>
<h3>What is a product manager’s role?</h3>
<blockquote><p> In a sense, every product is simply a means to satisfying a market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning <strong>meeting the needs of customers</strong>, a product manager is responsible for finding product-market fit and managing the product&#8217;s lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding the needs of the market through research and experiments</li>
<li>developing a <strong>minimum viable product</strong> that meets those needs affordably</li>
<li>being flexible and adapting the offering to the changing needs of customers &#8211; either through additional features on an existing product or by releasing all-new products</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are benefits?</h2>
<p>Benefits are the aspects of a product that satisfy a need. Food satisfies hunger, taxis satisfy our need for transportation, music satisfies our desire for entertainment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great idea to promote a product&#8217;s benefits to customers because they&#8217;re relatable. For example, if I told you that my product has a <em>built-in flux capacitor</em> feature, it wouldn&#8217;t have much meaning to you as a customer. If I told you that the product <em>lets you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or7P9jfhcZ0" target="_blank">travel back in time</a> </em> &#8230; well now you&#8217;re listening. Always consider how a product adds value to the customer through its benefits.</p>
<h2>What are features?</h2>
<p>Every product has features. Features are the identifiable attributes that offer benefits to a customer.</p>
<ul>
<li>A non-stick coating on a frying pan is a feature on a physical good.</li>
<li>Daily room cleaning is a feature of a hotel’s service.</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_91" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-91" src="http://roadmunkblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-1024x405.png" alt="Features convey benefits" width="640" height="253" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-1024x405.png 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-300x119.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-768x304.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-750x296.png 750w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-04-1140x451.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Roadmunk offices could probably use a free room cleaning service&#8230;</figcaption></figure>
<p>See how the features of a product offer benefits for the consumer? Ask yourself, would you prefer staying at a hotel that <em>has</em> free room cleaning or staying at one that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em>? If you&#8217;re like us&#8230; you&#8217;ll need the room cleaning. That <strong>feature </strong>adds benefits that help buyers choose one hotel&#8217;s product over the competition.</p>
<h3>What is a product manager’s role?</h3>
<p>Concerning feature development, product managers are responsible for delivering the right features to the right audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>collect feedback from customers and stakeholders, both behavioural and through conversation</li>
<li>prioritize new features based on market need and the organization&#8217;s ability to deliver</li>
<li>help introduce those new features to customers through onboarding, marketing and support</li>
<li>aligning the organization&#8217;s departments to &#8220;go-to-market&#8221; using the shared product roadmap</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is value?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Product managers are responsible for delivering the right features to the right audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Customers pay for a product (and its benefits) based on <strong>value</strong>. Every buyer makes up his or her mind a little bit differently, but all customers place a <strong>perceived level of worth</strong> &#8211; called value &#8211; on the collection of benefits offered by a product. That’s the imaginary usefulness a customer believes they will receive from the product. Value is perceived differently from person to person because environment, experience and preferences are unique to everyone.</p>
<p>Economists call this “utility”, and try to measure how much satisfaction a customer will receive from a product.</p>
<figure id="attachment_89" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-89 size-large" src="http://roadmunkblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-1023x1024.png" alt="Buyers decisions are based on value" width="640" height="641" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-1023x1024.png 1023w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-150x150.png 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-300x300.png 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-768x769.png 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02-750x751.png 750w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/what_is_a_product-02.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Customers weigh the benefits of a product against the costs.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>What is a product manager’s role?</h3>
<p>PMs work to prove that their products provide great value by <i> marketing </i> their product properly. Conveying benefits to customers in such a way that the product is perceived as authentic, affordable and satisfying:</p>
<ul>
<li>working with marketing and product marketing teams to create compelling benefits copy</li>
<li>asking a reasonable price for the product to balance the benefits in a customer&#8217;s buying decision</li>
<li>identifying the most attractive benefits through market research</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a product lifecycle?</h2>
<p>Most products won’t last forever. As customers’ needs and expectations change, older products in the market will be perceived as less valuable &#8212; to the point where customers aren’t willing to pay the same price they used to. If a company continued making the <i> same </i>obsolete<i> </i>product and charging the <i> same </i> price regardless of the market’s new expectations, eventually customers would refuse to purchase it. The value doesn&#8217;t meet the price.</p>

<p>Products necessarily entire “retirement”, known to product managers as <strong>maturity</strong> and <strong> end-of-life</strong>. Sellers have a variety of alternatives to deal with the market and fill the gap made by an obsolete product:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated versions</strong> of an old product will offer more relevant benefits for customers. PM&#8217;s call these <em>generations</em>.<br />
<em><em>Eg. a newer format music player or the next generation of mobile phone.</em></em></li>
<li>An <strong>all-new</strong> product might enter the market and take the old product’s place.<br />
<em><em>Eg. digital film, ballpoint pens, combustion engines, personal computers.</em></em></li>
<li>Some products will simply <strong>retire</strong> forever because customers don’t have the same needs any longer.<br />
<em>Eg. disco.<br />
</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is a product manager’s role?</h3>
<blockquote><p>Always consider how a product adds value to the customer through its benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the product team&#8217;s job to satisfy their customers&#8217; needs. In a sense, every product is simply <em>a means to satisfying a market</em>. If the market shifts, organizations need to adopt a <strong>new strategic roadmap</strong> to meet those needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>attracting new markets to sell mature products, new selling channels or new delivery formats</li>
<li>identifying new benefits within mature products</li>
<li>modifying existing products to address new customer needs</li>
<li>developing entirely new products to address customer needs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about how to start meeting those needs with a strategic roadmap, our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=whatisaproduct" target="_blank">template library</a> can help with that.</p>
<h2>Products deliver benefits to customers</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s what a product is! Quick review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products are <strong>goods</strong> and <strong><strong>services<br />
</strong></strong></li>
<li>They offer <strong>benefits</strong> to satisfy customer <strong><strong>needs<br />
</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Features</strong> convey those benefits</li>
<li>Customers make a <strong>buying decision</strong> based on <strong>value</strong> versus <strong>price</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing all that, let&#8217;s put it into practice. What <strong>price </strong>do you think the Roadmunk team would be <strong>willing to pay</strong> to watch their favorite baseball team together, live in Toronto?</p>
<figure id="attachment_93" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-93" src="http://roadmunkblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits.jpg" alt="Roadmunk @ Blue Jays 2015" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits.jpg 1024w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits-150x150.jpg 150w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits-300x300.jpg 300w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits-768x768.jpg 768w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rm-benefits-750x750.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Now what if we told you that baseball team had their best season in years?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some products will never have too high a price. Happy roadmapping, everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day ago I was listening in on a live support call from a customer out in Texas. He had a really friendly, appreciative attitude and thanked us for the assistance &#8211; but before he logged off he said something that stuck with me all night:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, that’s cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’ll take all the praise we can get. It&#8217;s just that Roadmunk support teams typically hear words like “helpful”, or “smart” or “cool”. But <em>cute</em> was a first. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post is all about how that introduced us to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a great opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was so cute, exactly?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, this isn’t the furry-fluffy kind of cute. Sorry, cute baby seal. </span></p>
<figure style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/72d2089f6eba2436534813ee21f144bc/tumblr_inline_nbpel5WSAh1riqfqx.gif" alt="Awwww baby seal" width="397" height="223" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo: thecutestofthecute.tumblr.com</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, he was referring to our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">legend modal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the right-side of the Roadmunk timeline view. It was just a coincidence that he noticed and commented on this feature. It might even be the first time you’ve seen it too. (It’s been there since our colors update.) We’re not surprised some users missed it, and that’s important.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_84" style="width: 504px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-84 size-full" src="http://roadmunkblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/modal.png" alt="cute hidden modal" width="504" height="552" srcset="https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/modal.png 504w, https://roadmunk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/modal-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Not the most obvious of UI elements, is it</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cute</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mean from a user’s experience? We dug around a bit to find out. We uncovered threads from other support cases that had similar language, and they all had the same few themes.</span></p>
<!-- This site is converting visitors into subscribers and customers with OptinMonster - https://optinmonster.com :: Campaign Title: Blog signup inline --><div id="om-ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg-holder"></div><script>var ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg,ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg_poll=function(){var r=0;return function(n,l){clearInterval(r),r=setInterval(n,l)}}();!function(e,t,n){if(e.getElementById(n)){ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg_poll(function(){if(window['om_loaded']){if(!ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg){ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg=new OptinMonsterApp();return ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg.init({"u":"25630.595075","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});}}},25);return;}var d=false,o=e.createElement(t);o.id=n,o.src="https://a.optnmstr.com/app/js/api.min.js",o.async=true,o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=function(){if(!d){if(!this.readyState||this.readyState==="loaded"||this.readyState==="complete"){try{d=om_loaded=true;ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg=new OptinMonsterApp();ytoapcdbhazgdychkbmg.init({"u":"25630.595075","staging":0,"dev":0,"beta":0});o.onload=o.onreadystatechange=null;}catch(t){}}}};(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.documentElement).appendChild(o)}(document,"script","omapi-script");</script><!-- / OptinMonster -->
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elements of cute UI</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some data mining revealed common themes from our sample support cases. Users who were responding using language like “neat”, “handy” and “convenient” had the same characteristics:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they discovered something new during the support call</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they were pleasantly surprised by what they learned</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the feature or item would be useful to them in some way</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more often than not, the feature in question wasn’t the intended topic of the call in the first place. It was a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tq5vXk0wTk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">happy accident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We wanted find more of these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we identify these features? We narrowed down the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the feature’s UI is unobtrusive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the feature is pleasantly helpful</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the feature is not frequently utilized</span></li>
</ul>
<figure style="width: 331px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AGIXgM8.gif" alt="cute ui elements doggie door" width="331" height="231" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Some features pack massive value into a small container. Source: Reddit</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By this logic, there are limitless cute features within the Roadmunk app when we consider how unique our users are. We’ve seen some outrageously-creative use cases for Roadmunk roadmaps, and we know our users all build roadmaps differently. That means there are different under-utilized, helpful features for every user. Try one of our <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmap-templates?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=cuteui" target="_blank">20+ customizable templates</a> for yourself and see which features are for you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you can find value for your app</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this experiment we concluded that there’s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in cute UI. A feature that meets the cute criteria is probably worth a look by a PM. Is it being under-utilized? Look for the clues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are useful features hard to access?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is there hidden potential in simple UI elements?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a handful of users reacted positively to these features in the past?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does your support team frequently offer this feature as a solution?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: ask your support teams for any insight into features that frequently but discreetly solve customer problems. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan to be adorable</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>There are different under-utilized, helpful features for every user</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product managers can capitalize on cute feature opportunities: planning ahead making useful UI elements more prominent, combining items, shifting divs, etc. Balancing new UI opportunities alongside planned feature releases is a challenge solved by the product roadmap. We’ve </span><a href="http://try.roadmunk.com/product-roadmap-template/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">example feature release roadmap templates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available if you need a foundation to start from. From all of us here at Roadmunk, plan happy everyone.</span></p>
